Indian Food Guide: Recipes - Overview of Pickles and Chutneys

These are the original spice girls!
Meant to preserve seasonal fruit and vegetables, they become an excuse for
bottling decadent flavours and tastes.
Most Indian pickles use a riot of spices. A far cry from their staid, sour and
vinegary counter-parts in continental European cuisine.
Chutneys pack in fantastic flavour and taste. But have to be consumed
immediately as they are almost always made from real fresh raw material.
Another advantage is that they come without oil and salt (So important in the
pickles). They often alternate between the sweet, sour and tangy.
Try out our finger-licking tomato, mint and tamarind chutneys.
Khatey rah jaogey! (You just won’t stop eating)!

Indian Food Guide: Recipes - Special Tips on Chinese Cooking

SPECIAL TIPS ON CHINESE COOKING
1. When cooking Chinese food at home, the secret lies in using absolutely fresh
vegetables in abundance and finely sliced.
2. As for the vegetables, french beans are almost always cut diagonally, onions
chopped or sliced fine and ginger and garlic crushed. Cabbage, spinach and
lettuce are shredded into fairly large pieces unless specified otherwise.
3. Make sure that the meat, fish and poultry are also finely sliced besides being
fresh and tender.
4. Gingelly oil may be used where no specific instructions have been given.
5. The use of cornflour in many Chinese dishes helps in three ways

i.  

ii.  

iii.  

Coating: It gives meat a light coating which not only makes the meat
tender but retains its flavour.
Thickening: The thickness of the gravy or soup depends on the amount of
cornflour used: these vary in different dishes, as a sweet and sour pork
dish should be fairly thick and tomato hot and sour soup should be thinner.
Holding: Cornflour holds minced meat together and also keeps the
moisture in. It is used in meat ball dishes.

1. Home made egg noodles: Beat 6 eggs lightly. Add a pinch of salt and sift in
enough flour to make a soft dough. Roll the dough very thinly (much thinner than
pie pastry) sprinkle flour on the surface to prevent it from sticking. Let it remain on
the table to dry for 30 minutes, then slice it into very fine strips. You can use
these egg noodles soup (soup with a few noodles) or fried noodles.
2. In the recipes given in this revised, new edition, the use of monosodium
glutamate has been completely dropped, as the commercially prepared, synthetic
variety has proven to be excessively harmful for health.
3. Most of he recipes given in this book serve 4-5 persons and completely
Chinese meal normally consists of 5 to 6 dishes.

bread as it is known can be toasted or baked and
can be made into a bowl or into a cone. Tortillas
were initially made by hand but now there are tortilla making machines. It is one
dish which cannot be overlooked in a Mexican meal. It can be served as a snack
or as a whole meal. Learn how to make different shaped tortillas with the below
mentioned points.

Indian Food Guide: Recipes - Paneer Know How

PANEER KNOW HOW
1.There are many types of cheese that are made in India on a small scale but
Paneer is the only cheese which can be compared to Western cheese in terms of
texture.
2.Good paneer can be made from milk which contains 5 % more fat than normal
milk. Therefore, buffalo milk is more suitable for preparing paneer.

3.To coagulate or curdle milk for paneer, add citric acid or lime juice to heated
milk.
4.Strain the curdled milk through a muslin cloth and squeeze out all the whey.
5.Chenna is the most popular form of cheese that is prepared in Indian homes
and used generously in cooking and confectioneries like rosogullas and sandesh.
6.If you want to cut paneer into a particular shape then place the paneer in a
rectangular tray and it will take that shape while setting. In this way it will be
easier to cut into squares, triangles etc.
7.Grated paneer can be used to decorate a simple dish and make it look quite
tempting or even a paneer burji can make your breafast more lively.
8.Vegetarian cooking looks and tastes a lot more delicious, as the soft colour of
paneer heightens the colours of the other ingredients.
9.Paneer not only looks but tastes delicious as well, no wonder it has carved a
niche for itself in the vegetarian world.

Indian Food Guide: Recipes - Tips on making Ice creams

TIPS ON MAKING ICE CREAMS
Some Chilling Tips
Earlier there were portable hand freezer to make ice cream, but now we have a
wide range of electrical freezer’s to select from. Want to prepare perfectly smooth
and soft ice creams ?
Just follow the below mentioned steps and help yourselves to embark on a sweet
frozen journey.
1.To start with, one might find the ice cream mixture to be very sweet, but don’t
worry as the sweetness will be lost during freezing.
2.Always freeze ice cream in shallow metal air-tight containers that touch the
base of the freezer as this helps in setting the ice cream more quickly.
3.Ice cream should be frozen quickly so as to give it a smooth texture, as slow
freezing leads to the formation of ice crystals.
4.You should always beat ice cream once it is half set to crush up the ice crystals
and this even improve the texture of the ice cream.
5.All ice cream containers should be chilled before pouring the mixture as it helps
to set the ice cream faster and minimises the formation of icicles.
6.Remove the ice cream about half an hour before serving.

Another example of adaptation.
What I have listed here as accompaniments can also be considered parts of the main
course. Indian traditional servings would hardly make a distinction between the main
course and the so-called accompaniments.
You can’t serve one without the other. It’s like having an omelet without salt and pepper
or a pudding without sugar!
Now try out the Boondi Raita or Dal Pakhtooni .... and salute the great Indian food

Indian Food Guide: Recipes - Overview of Soups and Salads

Overview
For all you guys who feel that soups are tasteless Continental gifts, try out my Tamatar
ka shorba. Or the Rasam.
Did I hear a South Indian protest? Rasam as Soup? When it’s eaten with the meal in the
same fashion as the dal or sambar?
Well, what did I tell you? Adaptation is the name of the game. A Rasam resembles soup
pretty well. Even though it’s a bit high on particular spices. Therefore doubling up also
as a digestive. But that’s the point. There aren’t any neat categories in Indian food.
So we are at liberty to slot them in ways we feel best!
As for Salads. They don’t have to be synonymous with vegetables. Try the chicken
chaat for now and feel the difference! Many rural Indian lunches or dinners include a
raw onion, green chilies, radishes or yogurt as a rudimentary salad. These have
become the norm even in Urban cuisine now.

Indian Food Guide: Recipes - Overview of Starters

Overview
They prepare you for the shape of things to come. As buffers between soups
and the main course.
Indian starters can range from the aloo or chicken tikka to idlis and Mirchi vadas.
Kehte hain na.. aagey aagey dekho hota hai kya! (As they say, wait and watch
what’s in store for you)
But don’t be surprised if you find that the starters have become a mini meal! After
all these items were traditionally cooked as snacks for breakfast or tea. They
have been re-invented to fit into the course- by - course format. Or as
accompaniments with drinks.
Vive la improvisation!

Coriander leaves, chopped 2 tbsp.
Tamarind water
1 cup
2 tbsp.
Jaggery
Oil
6 tbsp.
Salt
As required

1. Remove the centre large stem from each of the leaves.
2. Place a large leaf upside down and mix all the ingredients together except the
oil into a thick paste and add water if required.
3. Apply the mixture thinly on the leaf and place another leaf on top and again
apply the mixture.
4. Continue this process for 4 or 5 leaves if they are large or else 8 or 10 leaves if
they are small.
5. Tuck in the sides and roll as for a swiss roll and tie up securely with a string.
6. Make more Patrel rolls in a similar way. After they are all ready heat oil in a
pan, fry the Patrels on all sides, then cover the pan with a lid.
7. Put water on the lid and cook on low flame turning occasionally for 45 minutes
to 1 hour and cool.
8. Can be refrigerated for a week or so and eaten when desired.
9. When ready to eat, cut slices of the Patrel and shallow fry.
10. Serve with pieces of lemon.

Map of Indian Cuisine

From Taste of India

As food historian Colleen Taylor Sen explains, we can speak generally of “Indian food” in that 
all these regional cuisines bear some important similari>es: 
• Most Indian meals are starch‐based, centering on either rice or grain. 
• While only 30% of Indians are vegetarian, they consume about one‐tenth the animal 

products as Americans. 

• Rice or ﬂatbreads (ro( is the general term) are accompanied by pulses or dal (dried beans, 
mostly chickpeas or types of len(ls; soup made from pulses is also called dal) and form the 
basis of most Indian meals. Vegetables and more rarely meat are added as availability and 
aﬀordability dictate. 

2

• While many dishes are hot, it is 
mostly spice and not heat that 
enlivens meals.

• Masalas are spice mixtures that 

help to deﬁne certain dishes. 
Certain ones have become 
established. The best known here 
is garam masala, which can 
contain over 20 spices.

Curry powder is a Bri(sh inven(on 
that mimics a masala; “curry” is a 
general term for India’s spicy 
gravies, probably from the Tamil 
word kari. Neither the term or the 
powder is used in India; but the 
fresh leaf of the curry plant—
unrelated to the spice mix—is.

Condiments are also important to 
Indian meals. Vegetable pickles, 
preserved fruits, chutney 
(tradi(onally, a fresh relish; also a 
Bri(sh‐inﬂuenced fruit preserve), 
and raita (a yoghurt and vegetable 
salad) add nutrients as well as ﬂavor. 

Indian Dining Etiquette

• Indians traditionally do not use cutlery for eating, as 

many foods ‐ such as Indian breads and curry ‐ are best 
enjoyed when eating with the hand.

• If the food is soupy, such as many daals, spoons can be 
used. Additionally, foods such as rice may be eaten with 
spoons in both North and South India, more so in case 
of formal occasions as in a restaurant or a buffet where 
food is not served on banana leaf.

• Spoons (usually two used in a clasping motion) and 
forks are commonly used to distribute foods from a 
communal dish, as it is considered rude to touch the 
foods of others.

• Always use the right hand when eating or receiving 

food and never the left. 

• Hindus consider the cattle to be a sacred animal; beef is 

considered taboo. Therefore, restaurants in more 
conservative Indian states, do not include beef dishes in 
their menu. 

• It is not necessary to taste each and every dish 

prepared; but you must finish everything on the plate 
as it is considered a respect for served food, and food is 
sacred. For this reason, take only as much food on the 
plate as you can finish.

Most middle‐class Indians have two main meals, lunch and dinner, with a couple of snacks per 
day. Dessert dishes are treats, oUen associated with religious fes>vals or enjoyed as snacks.

Rice and len>ls were staples of India’s earliest inhabitants and sustain Indians today. Yet much 
of what we think of as Indian is actually quite new. Chai (spiced tea with milk) became popular 
there only in the 1950s. Even what many Indians would consider the most Indian dish today, 
tandoori chicken, actually came from (what is now) Pakistan with Peshawari refugees in the late 
1940s. And Indian food has taken on new life elsewhere as well. Bal( cooking is a new type of 
Indian food that developed in Birmingham, England.

Matrichaya
The food, health, and hygene ini(a(ves that Matrichaya, our featured program, has undertaken 
are aimed at empowering women to feed themselves and their families be,er and more 
regularly and safely. In the food processing course, women learn about nutri>on, how to vary 
their diet, and how to take best advantage of what they have. They learn to preserve the 
vegetables and fruits that grow well in Dheki Tola in summer for winter use. Among the things 
they learn to make are vegetable pickles, tomato sauces, and gooseberry preserves. They learn 
to make ﬂatbreads called missi ro( and pappad from nutri(ous mixes of grains and pulses. 

3

Pappad also has the advantage of being dried for long storage. They learn to use highly 
nutri(onal groundnuts (peanuts) in a variety of ways, even in a fudge‐ like confec(on called 
barﬁ. And, they learn to do something that most Indians do everyday: to add nuts, seeds, and 
pulses to rice in order to get a protein‐rich dish called khichri. A number of agencies are 
encouraging the plan(ng of second crops, especially groundnuts, pulses, and grains like millet 
(ragi), in Jharkhand. These are less suscep(ble to the periodic drought.

Matrichaya also provides women with a means to support themselves. The preserves, sauces, 
and pappads are sold in Matrichaya’s store at Acqua World, an amusement park in Ranchi. And 
their products also stock the new village store, along with staples that Urmi once would have 
had to walk miles to ﬁnd on her own.

Khichri with Red Len>ls 

This is the real na>onal dish of India, eaten twice a day by 
many. Depending on the region and the cook, it can be 
prepared with a variety of pulses (mainly, types of len(ls) and 
may be “wet “ (soupy) or “dry” (more like a pilaf, but s(ll 
“mushy”). The women of Dheki Tola were taught to make it 
with red len(ls, which are cheaper than other varie(es there. 

The word (also appearing as “khichdi,” “khitchri,” “khitcheri”) 
means “hodge‐ podge,” “mess,” or “chaos” and has come to be 
used for everything from government foibles to silly movies, 

according to Nupur at One Hot Stove.

Nupur’s recipe, which she calls “Khichdi,” to ﬁt with what Dr. Mishra has told me about the way 
it’s done in Jharkhand. Khichri could be an accompaniment to curries, but it is more typically 
eaten as the main dish with a vegetable pickle and ro(. It can be made and reheated the next

About the Author 

 

 

I am Vaishali Parekh, a resident of Kolkata, India and a Graduate 

Nutritionist. My passion for health and nutrition and a natural love 

for  cooking  drove  me 

to  come  up  with 

the  website 

 www.indian-cooking.info in the year 2007. 

I perpetually keep on searching for new ideas  and information related  to cooking, 

health  and  nutrition.  Wherever  I  go  and  whatever  I  do,  my  antennas  are  always 

alert  for  any  whiff  of  something  new  and  interesting.  As  soon  as  I  get  hold  of  an 

interesting piece of info, I process it and deliver it  to my readers with  the  help of 

my site. 

Most  of  the  times  I  deliver  info  for  free.  But  at  times  when  the  cost  of  acquiring 

specialized  info  is  quite  high,  I  am  left  with  no  other  option  but  to  charge  my 

readers. 

Enjoy  this  free  e-book,  and  after  you  have  finished,  don’t  forget  to  visit  the  link 

below for some well researched specialized information.

Nature & Us 

 

 

In  ancient  times  man  was  completely  at  the  mercy  of  nature.  Sometimes  nature 

was  extremely  harsh  on  him,  but  at  the  same  time  it  also  took  care  of  him  by 

providing him with all the resources that he needed to survive. 

It provided him with all the foods and medicines for him to stay healthy and active. 

In due course, man prospered and developed in every way possible – intellectually, 

financially and physically. 

Slowly  and surely man started drifting away from  his roots  and today  things have 

come  to  such  a  head  that  he  has  almost  forgotten  where  his  roots  are.  He  has 

begun considering himself as the Supreme Being who can control everything. In his 

pursuit of material possessions, he has become blind to the fact that nature has its 

own way of striking back. And when it does, all his acquired power will not be able 

to save him, as we have seen so many times in the past. 

So, why not try to reconnect with our roots? 

Why not try some simple and natural home remedies whenever you are down with 

some common ailment, instead of running to the doctor? 

I have developed an e-book on such remedies with painstaking effort, for you to go 

through. It shall be your asset throughout life. 

 

Check it out.

About Indian Vegetarian Cooking

Indian flavors have come to play an important role in international cuisine. 

It is unfortunate that many Westerners are under the impression that 
Indian cooking takes too long, calls for too many ingredients, and is overly 
spicy and greasy. Such misconceptions have arisen because the West was 
introduced to Indian cuisine in restaurants, where the primary concern is 
shelf life of the food, ease of preparation, and appearance. 

In reality, Indian food is healthful, colorful, aromatic, full of flavor, and easy 
to prepare. 

Every region of India has its own distinct way of cooking and its own 
specialties. The result is a huge variety of recipes with an endless array 
of savory main dishes based on rice, lentils, and vegetables, a wide 
assortment of breads, and a plethora of scrumptious desserts, snacks, and 
drinks. 

Spices are an essential element of Indian cuisine. The different 
combinations enhance the flavors of each dish and make each dish unique. 
But the benefits go far beyond taste and aroma. The spices used in Indian 
food are famous for their food preservation and medicinal properties as 
well.

Most of the dry goods and spices listed in this book are available at the 
Indian grocery stores and at Amazon.com. 

About Me and my website

http://www.manjulaskitchen.com

My kitchen is my art studio. Instead of playing with colors, I play with 
ingredients. Cooking is my hobby and my passion. For decades I have 
cooked for my family, friends, colleagues, and anyone who shows up at my 
home.

I was born in a vegetarian family in North India. My mother was an 
excellent cook who paid attention to every detail and always insisted on 
fresh ingredients. From a young age I enjoyed helping my mom in the 
kitchen. I learned how to use spices and herbs to enhance the taste of the 
vegetables, grains, and lentils. 

After I married and moved to the United States in the late 1960s, my family 
remained vegetarian because of our adherence to the Jain religion. One 
of the main principles of the Jain religion is the belief in non-violence 
to all living beings and the belief that we should “live and let live.” I am 
passionate about this way of life today.

Nothing gives me greater joy than sharing the traditional cuisine of 
India with you, in a practical format you can implement with ease and 
confidence.

To your Indian culinary adventure,

Bhel Puri

Spicy, Crunchy Snack
Bhel Puri is a simple spicy snack with a light crunch! This is 
a popular snack with street vendors in Mumbai. Every vendor 
has his own twist to bhel puri but two main ingredients remain 
the same . . . puffed rice (murmura) and fine sev. Bhel puri is a 
low-fat, nutritious, delicious snack!

Serves 4 to 6

INGREDIENTS
•  3 cups murmura (puffed rice) (available in Indian grocery 

stores)

•  1 cup fine sev (vermicelli-like snack made from gram flour) 

(available in Indian grocery stores)

•  1 cup papdi broken in small pieces (buy it in Indian grocery 

stores)

•  ½ cup potato boiled, peeled and cubed in small pieces
•  ½ cup cucumber peeled and cubed in small pieces
•  ½ cup tomatoes seeded and cubed in small pieces 

•  2 tablespoons cilantro, chopped
•  ½ teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)
•  4 tablespoons hari cilantro chutney 
•  4 tablespoons tamarind chutney 
•  1 tablespoon green pepper, minced (optional)
GARNISH
•  ¼ cup fine sev (vermicelli-like snack made from gram flour) 

(available in Indian grocery stores) 

•  2 tablespoons lemon juice

METHOD
1.  In a frying pan over medium heat, dry-roast the puffed rice for three to four minutes, Let it cool.
2.  Combine the dry ingredients (puffed rice, sev, papdi, and salt) together and mix well. Set aside until ready to serve.
3.  Mix chopped potatoes, cucumber, tomatoes, cilantro, and minced green pepper if you like it hot, and set aside. 
4.  When ready to serve, combine the dry ingredients and potato mixture.
5.  Add hari cilantro and tamarind chutneys to your taste, making sure the chutneys coat the bhel puri. Garnish with sev and 

drizzle with lemon juice to taste.

NOTES
Assemble bhel puri just before serving to prevent the puffed rice and sev from getting soggy.

SUGGESTIONS
Bhel puri dry mix can be prepared in advance and can be 
served as a dry snack or just with chutneys, without adding 
the veggie.  Bhel puri can be served as snack or even as a 
light lunch.

TIPS
Puffed rice (murmura) loses some of its crispness with time. 
Roasting restores the crispness and freshness.

bread to completely cover it all around, giving an oval 
shape.  

8.  Repeat to make all the rolls. Before frying, let them sit for 
about five minutes. (This will evaporate some of the water 
from the bread so that it absorbs less oil while frying, 
making the bread rolls crisper.)

rolls slowly into it, taking care not to overlap them.

Lentil Dumplings
Dahi Vadas are lentil dumplings dipped in yogurt and topped

Dahi Vada 

Makes about 30 

Watch the Video on Website

INGREDIENTS
 VADAS
•  ¾ cup washed moong dal (available in Indian grocery 

stores)

•  ¼ cup washed urad dal (available in Indian grocery stores)
•  Oil to fry 

METHOD
TO MAKE VADAS
1.  Mix both dals and wash.  
2.  Soak dal in four cups water for at least six hours. 
3.  Drain the water. In a blender, blend the dal to very creamy 
texture. Use only as much water as needed to blend. Using 
too much water for blending will not give the desired 
creamy texture. 

4.  Whip the dal batter, stirring with a spoon in a circular 

motion two to three minutes, until batter is light and fluffy. 
Add a few spoonfuls of water as needed.

5.  Use a flat frying pan, pan should have about ½ inch of oil 

and heat over medium high heat. Test the oil by dropping a 
little batter into it. When the oil sizzles, it is ready. 

6.  Place 1 tablespoon of batter into the oil. The oil should 
not be deep enough to cover the batter; the vadas will be 
softer if they are shallow-fried. The vadas will begin to 
expand slowly, without changing color. 

GARNISH
•  1½ cup yogurt (dahai, curd)
•  1 teaspoon salt
•  ½ teaspoon red chili powder
•  ½ teaspoon roasted cumin seed powder (jeera)*
•  3 tablespoons tamarind chutney

7.  Fry the vadas in small batches, until golden all around. 
8.  After you have made all of the vadas, place them in 

lukewarm water and soak for about 20 minutes. 

9.  Squeeze the vadas gently to remove the water, being 

careful not to break the vadas.

TO MAKE YOGURT TOPPING AND GARNISH
10. Mix two cups of yogurt until smooth. Add a little milk as 

needed to make the consistency similar to pancake batter 
or lassi. Add about one teaspoon salt, to taste.

11. Soak the vadas in the yogurt batter for at least half an 

hour, giving the vadas time to absorb the yogurt.

12. Slowly pick up each vada and transfer it to a serving dish. 

Pour a few spoons more yogurt over the Vadas.  

13. Just before serving, sprinkle some salt as needed, ground 
roasted cumin seeds, red chile powder, and finish off with 
a drizzle of tamarind chutney.

SERVING SUGGESTIONS
You can make the dahi vadas in advance and 
freeze them before soaking in water. 
When ready to use, soak as many as needed 
in hot water for about half an hour, then 
change the water to room temperature and 
soak for another ten minutes. 
Now proceed according to the recipe. 

VARIATIONS
Change the proportion of dals, or use only urad dal. 
As an alternative, you can add chopped green chilies and crushed coriander 
seeds to the dal batter just before frying.
Instead of serving with tamarind chutney, you can sprinkle chopped cilantro 
over the dahi vadas. 
If you are vegan, you can soak the vadas in tamarind chutney instead of 
yogurt and sprinkle some chopped cilantro or chopped mint leaves.

Fruit Salad
This is a bright, colorful, and refreshing fruit chaat (snack) 
that can also be used as a fruit salad. My siblings and I 
looked forward to the fruit chaat, served regularly as part of 
our lunch.  It was a delicious way of eating a great variety of 
fresh, seasonal fruit.  This by itself will brighten up any meal, 
and it tastes great at any time of day.

lot of color and texture to the dish.

Khasta Kachori

Spicy Puffed Pastry
Khasta kachori is a delicious, spicy, fried puff pastry. Kachoris 
are great as an appetizer or as part of a festive meal for any 
occasion.

Watch the Video on Website

Makes 12 Kachoris

INGREDIENTS
DOUGH
•  1 cup all-purpose flour (plain flour or 

maida)

•  ¼ teaspoon salt
•  2 tablespoons oil
•  ¼ cup chilled water, more or less as 

needed 

FILLING
•  ¼ cup yellow moong dal (available in 

Indian grocery stores)

•  1 teaspoon coarsely ground fennel 

seeds (saunf)

•  1 teaspoon coarsely ground coriander 

seeds (dhania)

•  1 teaspoon red pepper flakes

•  ¼ teaspoon ginger powder
•  ½ teaspoon mango powder (amchoor)
•  Pinch of asafetida (hing)
•  ½ teaspoon salt (adjust to taste) 
•  1 tablespoon oil
•  2 tablespoons water
•  Oil to deep-fry

METHOD
DOUGH
1.  Mix the flour, salt and oil. 
2.  Add the chilled water slowly, mixing with your fingers as you 

pour. 

3.  Do not knead the dough. It should be very soft. 
4.  Cover the dough and let it sit at least fifteen minutes. 
TO MAKE FILLING
5.  Grind the moong dal dry, almost to a powder.
6.  Mix 1 tablespoon of oil into the ground dal in a frying pan and 
roast over medium heat two to three minutes, or until the dal 
changes color slightly. Stir continuously. 

7.  Turn off the heat. Add all the spices and mix well. Let the 

mixture cool off. 

8.  Add two tablespoons warm water and mix well. 
9.  Let sit ten minutes, covered with a damp cloth.
TO MAKE THE KACHORIS:
10. Take the dough and knead it for minutes. Divide the dough in 

twelve equal parts. 

11. Take one part of the dough and with your fingers flatten the 

edges to form a three-inch circle, leaving the center a little 
thicker than the edges.  

12. Mold the dough into a cup and place one teaspoon of the filling 
in the center. Pull the edges of the dough to wrap the dal filling.  
Proceed to make all twelve balls.

13. Let the filled balls sit for three to four minutes before rolling. 
14. Set the filled balls on a surface with the seams facing up. 

Using the base of your palm, slowly flatten them into circles 
about three inches in diameter.

15. Heat the oil in frying pan over medium heat frying pan should 
have about one inch of oil.  To check if oil is ready put a little 
piece of dough in the oil. It should sizzle, and come up very 
slow.

16. Fry them on medium-low heat. After they start to puff, slowly 

turn them over. Fry until golden-brown on both sides. If the 
kachoris are fried on high heat, they will get soft and will not be 
crispy.

17. Kachoris can be stored for at least a week in an airtight 

container. 

VARIATIONS
Instead of using moong dal, you can use washed urad dal or chana 
dal. The rest of the recipe remains the same. 

SERVING SUGGESTIONS
Kachoris can be served plain, with a variety of 
chutneys, with chola (a chickpea dish), or with dam 
aloo (a potato dish). Serve them as a chat, pouring 
plain yogurt and chutney on top.

TIPS
Don’t roll the kachoris with a rolling pin. Rolling pins can create small holes in 
the dough that let the oil seep into the kachoris, and they can also cause the 
kachoris to come out with one side thicker than the other.

1.   Mix tomatoes, cucumbers, cilantro, ginger, and green chili. Set aside.
2.  Mix all the dry ingredients to make a spice mix. Set aside.
3.  Lightly oil the papads on both sides, set aside. 
4.  Preheat the skillet over medium high heat. Roast the papads on both sides in the skillet one at a time, pressing with 

spatula. The papads will change to a light yellow with a few brown spots. Be careful not to over-roast. Fold the Papads in 
quarters while they are hot, making triangles right on the skillet. 

5.  Remove the papads from the skillet and break on the folds, creating four triangles from each one. 
6.  Take one piece of papad and top it with cucumber, tomato, ginger, green chili, and cilantro. Drizzle with lemon juice and 

sprinkle the spice mix on top.

NOTES
Removing the seeds from the tomatoes keeps the papads crunchy. 
English cucumber is crisper on the outside and tender on the inside.
You can prepare the masala papad in advance, and add the toppings just before serving.

Watch the Video on Website

Serves 4

INGREDIENTS
•  1 cup matara (light brown in color, they look almost like 

chick peas; available in Indian grocery stores)

•  1 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)
•  1 teaspoon black salt (adjust to taste)
•  ¼ teaspoon black pepper
•  ¼ teaspoon sugar
•  1 tablespoon cumin seed 
•  1 tablespoon coriander 

METHOD
1.  Wash and soak the matra in three cups of water overnight. 
After soaking, the matra will be about 2½ times the volume 
of the original.

2.  Dry roast the cumin seeds and coriander separately, until 
they are brown and you can smell their aroma. Let them 
cool and grind to powder consistency. 

3.  Put the matra in a pressure cooker with 2½ cups of water. 
Add the salt, ginger, and green chili. Cook on medium high 
heat.

•  2 tablespoons ginger, finely chopped 
•  2 small green chilies, finely chopped (adjust to taste)
•  2 tablespoons tamarind pulp
•  1 tablespoon lemon juice
FOR GARNISH
•  A few slices of lemon 
•  2 tablespoons ginger, finely chopped
•  2 green chilies, finely chopped

4.  When the pressure cooker starts to steam, turn the heat 

down to medium and cook eight to nine minutes more.
5.  Turn off the heat and wait until the steam has stopped 

before opening the pressure cooker. Matra should be soft 
and tender.

6.  Add all the spices; this is the time to adjust the salt and 

pepper to your taste. Mix the spices well. Add a little water 
if they look too dry; the gravy should be thick. 

SERVING SUGGESTIONS
Serve warm. Garnish with ginger and slices of green chili and lemon.

Chapter 1- Farewell the Winterline

A 5-month-old Stanley held 
high in the arms, close to the 
loving face of my first ayah, 
Marrimma.

She was a family servant from the 
Telugu speaking region of south India.

A family anecdote recalled the 
awestruck remark by a now-forgotten 
relative who, upon seeing this picture 
for the first time, remarked about how 
much Helen (my mother) had changed!

Bhakari

2 cups whole.wheat flour

1 teaspoon salt

2 tablespoons vegetable oil

1/4 cup milk

1/2 cup water

Combine the flour, salt, oil, milk, and half the water 
in a bowl. Mix using a wooden spoon or fingers. Add 
more water, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) at a time until the 
dough forms a ball. Knead the dough with lightly 
oiled hands for 10 minutes. The dough should be 
fairly firm. Allow the dough to rest, covered with a 
dish cloth, for 15 minutes.

Divide the dough into 4 to 6 pieces. Roll each piece 
into a round 1/4 inch thick. Heat a flat griddle or 
large skillet over moderate heat. Cook the dough, one 
piece at a time, pressing it down occasionally with a 
spatula, until cooked and lightly browned on the 
bottom. Turn the dough and repeat. The dough may 
balloon slightly during cooking. Repeat with 
remaining pieces of dough.
Makes 4 to 6 pieces.

2 cups puffed rice

2 oz. salted peanuts

1 tbsp. tomato sauce

1/2 tsp. salt or to taste

Among Khargpur friends one stood 
out– Lewin Brown.

Chapter 2 - Farewell the Winterline

A letter postmarked 5 Apr 40 with Lewin Brown´s 
signature profile (a very good likeness) to match 
George VI´s profile on the stamps.

He was much older, but that didn't matter. He was 
a talented artist and performer and a relaxed, good 
humored person. We spent hours at Lewin's place, 
catching up on gossip and enjoying his art, 
including beautiful books which featured the 
undraped female form, as the delicate expression 
put it. Lewin did very good portraits in oil.

Lewin was a  devotee of American movies, many 
which he saw from the film projection booth at the 
Institute. His job was to letter and draw in India ink 
the glass-slide announcements which were 
projected on the screen during the intermission in 
the program. He expertly dashed them off at a 
small table in the booth. 

Lewin mastered many of Fred Astaire's dance 
routines, which he incorporated into his own 
presentations. He was also a fine dancer in the 
Kathakali school of Indian classical dance–a 
remarkable celebration of his heritage at a time 
when Anglo-Indians found its public 
acknowledgment difficult. Looking back, it is clear 
that he was one of those rare individuals who 
expand beyond conventional limits.

Lewin & Irene during a delightful visit at their 

London home. (1966)

Naan

4 cups all.purpose flour

1 Tablespoon sugar

1 Tablespoon double.acting baking powder

1/4 teaspoon baking soda

1/2 tsp salt

2 eggs

1 cup milk

4 to 6 teaspoons ghee or melted butter

Combine the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl and 
stir until the ingredients are thoroughly mixed. Make a 
well in the center of the mixture and add the eggs, 
stirring them into the mixture. Add the milk in a thin 
stream (or a little at a time if you only have two hands), 
and stir until all the ingredients are well combined.

Gather the dough into a ball and knead for about 10 
minutes, adding a little flour as needed to prevent 
sticking, until the dough is smooth and can be gathered 
into a soft, somewhat sticky ball. Moisten your hands 
with a teaspoon of ghee, rub it over the ball of dough,
and place it in a bowl. Drape a kitchen towel over the 
bowl and allow to sit at room temperature for about 3 
hours.

Place two ungreased baking sheets in the oven and 
preheat the oven and the sheets to 450F. Divide the 
dough into 6 equal pieces and flatten each into a tear 
drop, or leaf shape about 6 inches long and 31/2 inches 
across at its widest point. Use your fingers to do this, and 
moisten them with ghee as needed to prevent the dough 
from sticking. The ghee also assures the proper texture of 
the bread, so moisten your fingers with it even if the 
dough is not sticky.

Arrange the bread â(cid:160) œleavesâ(cid:160) • side by side on the 
preheated baking sheets and bake them for about 6 
minutes, or until they are firm to the touch. Slide them 
under the broiler for a minute or so to brown the tops 
lightly. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Dr. Whitcomb examing a patient while 
squatting on the floor in the Indian 
manner.

Dr. Whitcomb specialized in 
cataract removals, restoring sight to 
villagers in a way that to them seemed 
to be miraculous!  I had never seen 
anything as moving as an incident which 
happened in the operating room one 
afternoon. An old villager was on the 
operating table. His relatives squatted 
along the wall, watching. After removing 
the cataract, Dr. Whitcomb held two 
fingers in front of the patient's face, and 
asked, in Hindi, "How many?" The old 
man began to tremble. "Two," he said 
and realizing that he could see, began 
fumbling for Dr. Whitcomb's hand to kiss 
it. The family rushed forward to touch 
the doctor's feet in a gesture of 
profound gratitude. I felt like joining 
them! Dr. Whitcomb kept all of the old 
cataracts, hundreds of them, in a glass 
"trophy" jar.

1/2 gallon full fat milk

2 cups cooked rice

1 cup raisins

1/2 cup sugar

Boil milk in a heavy bottomed saucepan until it reduces

Then just before midnight on 
June 15th our ship anchored 
in the Lower Bay of New York 
harbor. The lights of the city, not yet 
blacked out (as they undoubtedly 
should have been), brightened up 
the night sky. Our journey begun 
two and a half months earlier and 
covering some 22,000 miles was 
safely over. In a spontaneous 
collective act the passengers on 
deck, who were mostly 
missionaries, sang the Doxology 
together. It starts with the words, 
"Praise God, from Whom all 
blessings flow!" Our relief and 
gratitude for a safe arrival were 
certainly deeply felt and sincerely 
expressed. 

     June 16th was the day of 
debarkation and dispersal at the 
Hudson River pier. First off were 
the POWs. Then came the FBI and 
Naval Intelligence interviews, each 
thirty minutes long, conducted in 
alphabetical order. The Supplees 
and Tituses waited until 6:30 pm for 
theirs. "Amstutz" and "Brush" were 
among the first. Not the ideal 
circumstances under which to say 
good-bye, but we managed.

1 medium onion, finely chopped

1 (3.inch long) cinnamon stick

1 cup milk

1/4 cup seedless raisins

1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom

1/2 teaspoon powdered saffron

Salt, to taste 

Soak the rice in 3 cups cold water for 30 minutes. Drain 
the rice, reserving the water, and set aside. Cut the 
peaches lengthwise into 1/2.inch slices. Heat the ghee or 
oil in a large saucepan over moderate heat and saute the 
peach slices until golden on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes. 
Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

In the same ghee, saute the almonds until golden brown, 
about 2 minutes. Remove and drain. Repeat with the 
pistachios. Set the almonds and pistachios aside. Add the 
onion to the ghee remaining in the pan and saute until 
tender, about 3 minutes. Add the cinnamon stick and fry 
for 1 minute. Add the rice and stir constantly for 2 
minutes, until the rice begins to brown and is thoroughly 
coated with the ghee. Add the reserved water, milk, 
raisins, cardamom, saffron and salt.

Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally to prevent the rice 
from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Reduce the heat 
to low and simmer covered for 10 minutes. Remove from 
the heat and allow to sit covered for 15 minutes. Fluff the 
rice with a fork, remove and discard the cinnamon stick, 
and transfer to a serving platter.
Surround the rice with the reserved peach slices and 
sprinkle with the almonds and pistachios.

From the Afterword:

Kharagpur (the standard modern 
spelling), the Union Church and 
house, the station, the residential areas 
and the market are still there. But 
"Bengal Nagpur Railway" as a name has 
disappeared, having been replaced by 
the more prosaic "South Eastern 
Railway." Contemporary Kharagpur's 
chief claim to fame is its elite Institute of 
Technology.

     Our seaside resort at Chandipur has 
been absorbed into a missile test range 
for the Indian navy. But the beautiful 
beach of our day is gone. It was 
destroyed by a Bay of Bengal cyclone in 
the early 1990s
.
     The wartime airfields (except for 
Chakulia and Kalaikunda), which half a 
century ago were busy with airmen and 
their planes, are abandoned. Their 
crumbled runways now mingle with the 
general historical detritus left by other 
exotic warriors who passed through India 
before them. The dead at Kalaikunda 
were transferred after the war, in 
accordance to the wishes of relatives, 
either home to the US or to the 
permanent American military cemetery at 
Carthage, Tunisia.

  

Now, approaching the sesquicentennial 
of its founding in 1854, Woodstock has 
transformed itself into an international 
school suited to the educational needs of 
the new India.

The air in our house was sodden,
the walls bulging with moisture
as the monsoon rains fell. 

"The eensy, weensy spider
went up the water spout..."

Water twisted in heavy ropes from drainpipes

and arched from the roof corners,

water so thick I couldn´t see

across the verandah.

"Down came the rain

and washed the spider out..."

We all took cover - 

spiders, mosquitos, scorpions, us.

Mother told us to shake out our shoes

before putting them on,

to reach for cups

by their handles, not the rims.

Check everything:

pockets, coatsleeves, between the sheets.

And we were sentenced to the living room floor

with scissors and crayons
to make paperdoll families

from pictures in the Sears & Roebuck catalog.

"Out came the sun

and dried up all the rain..."

When the sky cleared

we began to emerge, like earthworms
flooded to the surface of the ground,

sent off to school again
armed with vials of salt

 to loosen leeches from our ankles.

"The eensy, weensy spider
went up the spout again."

Sunlight knifed between the trees in the woods,

cut across our path

searching out furtive remnants of water.

Through my classroom window

I watched a fiery drop slide down a thread

in the huge new spiderweb anchored 

between the sill and the eaves,

splintering my view of the courtyard

into sharp geometric fragments.

Making Indian Food At Home 

A collection of recipes from Anupy Singla’s new book “Indian for Everyone.” 

 
 

Chicken Tikka Masala 

Yield: 5 cups / 1.2 L masala  
 
(Note: Before adding chicken) 
 
This dish, which is ubiquitous on Indian restaurant menus, likely had origins outside of India. 
According to one story, a restaurateur in England created it by combining grilled chicken, 
tomatoes, cream, and spices. Some say its origin was in Glasgow or Birmingham, while others 
(including my cousins Rahul, Vikram, and Puja) insist the recipe comes from Newcastle, their 
childhood home. No matter how or where it came about, we’re all so glad it did. 
 
Tools:  You’ll need a heavy-bottomed, 4-quart / 4-L sauté pan and a blender or immersion 
(stick) blender. 
 
Ingredients: 
 
1 tablespoon / 45 mL ghee or vegetable oil 
2 teaspoons cumin seeds 
1 teaspoon turmeric powder 
1 large yellow or red onion, diced 
1 tablespoon plus 1 pinch salt, divided 
1 (2-inch / 5-cm) piece ginger, peeled and minced or grated 
10 cloves garlic, peeled and minced or grated 
4 large tomatoes, peeled and diced* 
1 heaping tablespoon tomato paste 
1–3 fresh Thai, serrano, or cayenne chiles, stems removed and chopped 
6 green cardamom pods, slightly crushed 
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
1 tablespoon light brown sugar 
1 teaspoon ground black pepper 
1 teaspoon red chile powder or cayenne pepper 
1 cup / 240 mL boiling water 
¼ cup / 25 g blanched sliced almonds, toasted 
¼ cup / 60 mL half & half or heavy cream 
3 cups / 420 g diced Tandoori Chicken 
2 teaspoons unsmoked paprika 
Brown or white basmati rice, Roti, or Naan, for serving 
 
Directions: 

1.  In a heavy-bottomed, 4-quart / 4-L sauté pan over medium–high heat, warm the ghee. 

Add the cumin seeds and turmeric and cook for 40 seconds, until the cumin seeds sizzle 
and turn reddish-brown. 

2.  Add the onion and the pinch of the salt to the sauté pan and cook, stirring occasionally, 

for 4 minutes, until the onion is slightly browned. Add the ginger and garlic and cook for 
1 minute. 

3.  Add the tomatoes, the tomato paste, the fresh chiles, the cardamom, the cinnamon, the 

brown sugar, the remaining 1 tablespoon of salt, the black pepper, and the red chile 
powder to the sauté pan and bring the mixture to a boil. 

4.  Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, until the 
tomatoes break down and all the ingredients start to pull together except the oil, which 
will start to separate. Add the water and almonds and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from 
the heat. 

5.  Transfer the mixture to a blender or use an immersion (stick) blender in the sauté pan and 

process until smooth. 

6.  Return the sauté pan containing the mixture to medium heat and add the half & half. Fold 

in the chicken and paprika and cook for 5 minutes, until warmed through. Serve 
immediately with the brown or white basmati rice, Roti, or Naan. 

 
 
Veganize It! Instead of chicken, you can use 24 to 28 ounces / 680 to 790 g of Baked Tofu, 
seitan, or tempeh and substitute Cashew Cream or coconut creamer for the half & half. You can 
even leave the cream out entirely, as the almonds should add all the richness you’ll need. If you 
choose to do so, the cook time for Step 4 should increase to 20 minutes, and you may need to add 
a little water if the sauce starts to dry out.

Spinach Pakoras 

 
Yield: 17-20 pieces 
 
Tools: You’ll need 2 large mixing bowls; a kadhai, wok, or saucepan; a slotted spoon; a baking 
sheet; and a small, flat bowl. 
 
Ingredients: 
 
2 cups / 90 g packed, chopped fresh spinach 
1 medium red onion, diced 
1 (2-inch / 5-cm) piece ginger, peeled and grated or minced 
1–3 fresh Thai, serrano, or cayenne chiles, stems removed and finely sliced 
1 cup / 110 g besan (gram or chickpea flour) 
1 teaspoon salt 
1 teaspoon red chile powder or cayenne pepper 
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder 
1/2 teaspoon ajwain (carom seeds) 
1/2 cup / 120 mL plus 1 tablespoon warm water 
2 cups / 470 mL vegetable oil, for frying 
 
Directions: 
 
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the spinach, onion, ginger, and fresh chiles and mix well to 
combine. Set aside. 
 
2. In a separate large mixing bowl, combine the besan, salt, red chile powder, turmeric, and 
ajwain and stir well to combine. You can also add other spices, including garam masala, ground 
black pepper, and so on. Be as creative as you like. Add the water to the besan mixture and stir 
until smooth. This mixture should be slightly thick and not too watery. Make sure that there are 
no lumps in the batter. 
 
3. Slowly fold the spinach mixture into the batter. 
 
4. In a small kadhai, wok, or saucepan over medium–high heat, warm the oil. The oil should be 
about 1 inch / 3 cm deep in the deepest part of the kadhai. You’ll know the oil is hot enough if 
you drop in a cumin seed and it sizzles and rises to the top immediately. 
 
5. Using a tablespoon measure, carefully place 4 tablespoons / 60 mL of batter into the oil, 1 at a 
time, and cook for about 30 seconds on 1 side, until lightly browned but just shy of being cooked 
through. Turn over each of the pakoras and cook for 30 seconds more. 
 

6. Remove the pakoras with a slotted spoon and transfer to a baking sheet lined with a paper 
towel to absorb extra oil. Place a small, flat bowl on top of each pakora and press down lightly. 
 
7. Return the pakoras to the hot oil and cook for 30 to 40 seconds on each side, until golden 
brown. Remove from the heat. Remove the pakoras with a slotted spoon and transfer to the 
baking tray lined with fresh paper towels to absorb the oil. My aunts in Chandigarh insist on 
doing this to ensure the pakoras are extra crispy. It also helps to make sure they cook through. 
Don’t worry: You can fry them just once as well. Just cook them a little longer to ensure they 
cook through. 
 
8. Repeat Steps 5, 6, and 7 until you have finished frying all the pakoras. Remove from the heat. 
 
9. Transfer the pakoras to a serving platter and serve them with a side of Pudina 
ki and/or Imlee ki Chutney (see recipes on pp. 41 and 42). 
 
 
Cooking Tips: The oil should be about 350°F / 180°C, but not much hotter than that. If you feel 
like the pakoras are frying too quickly, reduce the heat to low. You don’t want them to cook too 
quickly on the outside and then remain uncooked on the inside. 
 
You can also make a batch and keep them in the oven on the warm setting to serve later, or pan 
fry or bake them. If baking, place 1 tablespoon of batter in each section of an oiled or nonstick 
muffin pan and bake for 25 minutes at 350°F / 180°C. Flip them over and bake for 1 to 2 minutes 
for extra crispiness. Remove from the oven.

Dal Makhani: Buttered Black Lentils 

 
Yield: 8 cups / 1.9 L 
 
Tools: You’ll need a large, deep mixing bowl; a deep, heavy-bottomed, 6-quart / 6-L stockpot or 
Dutch oven; a food processor; and an 8-inch / 20-cm sauté pan with a lid. 
 
Veganize It! Substitute vegan margarine for the ghee and Cashew Cream or coconut or soy 
creamer for the dairy cream. 
 
In Hindi, makhan means butter. Probably the most frequently ordered dal in Indian restaurants, 
this Punjabi version is a combination of urad dal, kidney beans, and butter, and is at once hearty 
and comforting. Make it in its traditional celebratory style with layers of butter and cream, or 
lighten it up for daily fare. 
 
Ingredients: 
 
13/4 cups / 360 g sabut urad (whole, dried black dal with skin), picked over and washed 
1/2 cup / 90 g rajmah (dried red kidney beans), picked over and washed 
1 teaspoon turmeric powder 
2 cassia or bay leaves 
1 (3-inch / 8-cm) stick cinnamon 
3 whole cloves 
12 cups / 2.8 L water, plus more if needed 
1 medium yellow or red onion, coarsely chopped 
1 (1-inch / 3-cm) piece ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped 
4 cloves garlic, peeled 
4 tablespoons / 60 mL ghee or vegetable oil 
1 teaspoon cumin seeds 
1 teaspoon cumin powder 
1 teaspoon ground coriander 
1 teaspoon red chile powder or cayenne pepper 
1–3 fresh Thai, serrano, or cayenne chiles, stems removed and chopped 
1 (6-ounce / 170-g) can tomato paste, unsalted 
1/4 cup / 60 mL water, plus more if needed 
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon salt 
1/4 teaspoon cardamom seeds, ground 
1 teaspoon kasoori methi (dried fenugreek leaves), lightly hand crushed to release flavor 
1/4 cup / 60 mL half & half or heavy cream 
2 heaping tablespoons minced fresh cilantro, for garnish 
Brown or white basmati rice, Roti, or Naan for serving 
 
Directions: 
 
1. In a large, deep mixing bowl, soak the sabut urad and rajmah in at least 8 cups / 1.9 L of 
water overnight. If you’re pressed for time, place them in boiling water and allow them to soak 

them for at least 4 hours. If you do, you should increase the cooking time by 30 to 45 minutes. 
Drain and discard the water when finished soaking. This will seem like a lot of water, but the 
beans absorb a lot. 
 
2. Combine the 2 beans, the turmeric, the cassia leaves, the cinnamon, the cloves, and the 12 
cups / 2.8 L water in a deep, heavy-bottomed, 6-quart / 6-L stockpot or Dutch oven over 
medium–high heat and bring to a boil. 
 
3. Reduce the heat to medium–low and simmer, partially covered, for 11/2 hours. Remove from 
the heat, cover, and set aside to cool slightly while you prep the remaining ingredients. If a light 
film forms at the start of cooking, simply skim it off, discard, and continue to cook. 
 
4. In the bowl of a food processor, grind together the onion, ginger, and garlic into a watery 
paste. Set aside. 
 
5. In a separate 8-inch / 20-cm sauté pan over medium–high heat, warm the ghee. Add the cumin 
seeds and cook for 40 seconds, until the cumin seeds sizzle and turn reddish-brown. 
 
6. Carefully add the paste from Step 4 to the sauté pan. It will splatter as the moisture from the 
onion hits the hot oil, so keep a lid handy. Stir well and cook for 4 minutes, until the mixture is 
slightly browned. Add the cumin powder, coriander, red chile powder, and fresh chiles, stir well, 
and cook for 40 seconds. 
 
7. Carefully add the tomato paste, the 1/4 cup / 60 mL water, and the salt to the sauté pan. This 
mixture can also splatter, so keep the lid handy. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes. Use a 
little more water if needed to make sure the mixture doesn’t dry out. Remove from the heat.

15.  Sweet Pongal 
 
Ingredients (for two people) :-   
Moong dhal - 1/2 cup.             
Rice       - 1/2 cup.             
Milk 
Coconut  
cashew  
jaggery                                                                       
raisins (khish-mish - dry grapes)                                            
cardamom                                                           
ghee.                                                                        
                                                                             
Fry the moong dhal (before washing) till it becomes little light brown (it   
will start smelling). Then soak rice and dhal separately for 10 minutes.     
Thoroghly wash and keep it in cooker with the right water (lesser is o.k)and 
cook it seperately (in two different containers). Meanwhile cut coconut in   
very small pieces and fry in ghee. Fry cashew and raisins also separately.   
Break the jagerry and put in water (very little) and make a syrup. This is   
done because sometimes jagerry has mud and stones. After we make the syrup 
strain it through tea strainer. Put the rice and dhal in a big vessel and    
add milk (may be one  cup) and cook it till all the milk gets absorbed. Add  
jaggery syrup and again cook till even it gets absorbed. Add three big table 
spoons of ghee, powdered cardamon and cook again for a while. Add fried      
coconut, cashews and raisins.

Following is the thread test (tar) to check required consistency of syrup (chashni). If no thread is formed, but 
there is stickiness in the syrup when tested, then it is 3/4 tar (thread). This consistency is generally used in 
dipping sweets like, gulabjamoon, boondi, jalebi, imarti, etc. Boil some more and when 1 tar forms, it is used 
in soaking pancake pancakes like malpua. On further boiling two tars are obtained and this is used in sweets 
like burfis, mohanthal, etc. At this stage a drop of syrup dropped on a plate will form a soft ball when cooled. 
After this stage do no stir briskly and continuously or the sugar will recrystallise. Still further boiling will form 
2 1/2 to 3 tars and this syrup is used to get a white coating of sugar on sweets like balushahi, surti ghari, etc. 
At this stage when the syrup is dropped in a plate it will form a hard ball when cooled. Following are the steps 
shown to make sugar syrup (chashni) in the right way.  
 
a.Take sugar and water in the ratio of 2 : 1 1/2 unless other wise mentioned.  
b.Put both in a deep saucepan to boil, stirring occasionally.  
c.When the mixture comes to a boil, add 1/2 cup milk.  
d.When a thick scum is formed on the surface of syrup, it is time to strain.  
e.Always use a metal strainer or moist cloth to strain the hot syrup, never plastic.  
f.Put back to boil, checking the consistency required as above.  
g.Check frequently, because once the first thread forms, it proceeds to thicken to the next stages very quickly.  
h.Use as required in the recipe. Make syrup side by side of making the recipe, reheating the syrup too many 
times will alter the texture of the resulting sweet dish. To save time, prepare the syrup on a second burner, 
while making the rest of the recipe. This will avoid excess wastage of time and unnecessary cooling off, of the 
fried flours, etc. as the recipe demands.

partially 
     ground rice and keep it apart for cooking and later mixing.(This will be called KURUKKU).

the 
     mixture to rise. Grind the coconut to a milky emulsion. Mix your ground rice, 'Kurukku'(cook the partially

little 
     coconut milk to adjust the consistency.(You can add one beaten up egg at this stage if you fear appams 
sticking 
     to the pan.- Alternately you can wrap a half fried egg in cloth and use it to rub the frying area of your pan.) 
     Now put the mixture in a warm oven for 2 hours just before you make the Appams

                                pan for the batter to spread out thinly and evenly. You shouldn't use an  
 
                                     implement to spread the batter. It should spread on its own.

1/4 tsp tumeric 
2 tsp grated ginger root 
1/3 cup chopped tomatoes 
1 green chili, chopped 
1 tbspn nonfat plain yogurt 
2-3 tbsp chopped cilantro leaves 
1/2 tsp garam masala 
(see below) 
Wash, drain, and cut cauliflower into 1 inch flowerets, including stem. 
Combine chili powder, ginger, tomato, green chili, tumeric with the yogurt in  
A small bowl. Spray with pam, use nonstick pan, use a little water, whatever 
you do to nonstick yourself. Put Cauliflower into pan then pour spices over 
the top. Cover pan tightly and cook over LOW heat for 10-15 minutes  
(Cauliflower will steam in the spicy mixture). Stir in half the cilantro 
leaves, increase heat to medium, and cook with lid off, for another 5-6 
minutes, to drive off excess moisture. turn off heat and sprinkle with  
garam masala and reamaining cilantro. Make sure all liquid is driven off, 
serve with basmati rice. 4 servings, less than 98 calories 
 
GARAM MASALA 
2 oz. black cardamom pods, 1 oz piece of cinnamon stick, 1 oz. cloves,  
2 oz. peppercorns 
Heat a heavy skillet, reduce heat, add pods and cinnamon. Move them around 
for two minutes. Add clves and peppercorn, and shuffle for another minute. 
Turn off heat, but continue shuffling until the heat is out of the pan. 
Pour roasted spices into grinder and grind til you have a fine powder. 
If not fine, strain it, and discard what won't pass through strainer. 
 
187.  Garam Masala 
5 tsp coriander seeds   1 Tbsp. cumin seeds     1 Tbsp black peppercorns 
1 tsp whole cloves      1 tsp cinnamon          1 tsp green cardomon pods 
 
toast coriander and cumin seeds for 3-5 min.  combine w/other ingredients and 
grind in mortar/pestle (or blender which works great for me).  Store in a 
bottle for up to 6 months.  This is a great spice mixture!  But normly I don't 
have those spices on hand so I cook without it.  But you might consider it 
worth investing in as its a neat combination of spices for cooking.

2-3 chopped onions  
a bunch cashews  
oil to make dosas  
Method 

•  Mix rava, maida, rice flour together into a thick batter adding little water at a time so no lumps are 

formed. Mixing by hand is a good idea if you don't have a whisk or electric mixer. Add salt, crushed 
cumin asafoetida and leave in a warm spot for six to seven hours at least.

•  Sprinkle some of the cut onions and cashews onto the pan and now continuing on low-medium heat, 
drizzle the batter such that there is a latice work effect. A lot of holes is just the thing. Dribble a bit 
bit of oil around it and when the edges start turning brown coax it off the pan with a flat, wide spatula 
and flip it over. Remove in a few minutes and make more.

250.  Basic Curry Sauce 
Ingredients  
 

• 
• 
• 
• 

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

3 tablespoons vegetable oil or ghee (clarified butter)  
1 medium onion - finely chopped  
4 cloves garlic - peeled and sliced  
1.5 inch piece root ginger - peeled and thinly sliced (it should look about the same volume as the 
garlic)  
(optional) 2 mild fleshy green chillies - de-seeded and veined then chopped  
half teaspoon turmeric powder  
half teaspoon ground cumin seed  
half teaspoon ground coriander seed  
5 tablespoons plain passata (smooth, thick, sieved tomatoes, US = purée) or 1 tablespoon 
concentrated tomato purée (US = paste) mixed with 4 tablespoons water  

Heat the oil in a heavy pan then add the chopped onion and stir for a few minutes with the heat on high.  
Add the ginger, garlic and green chilli (if using). Stir for 30 seconds then put the heat down to very low.  
Cook for 15 minutes stirring from time to time making sure nothing browns or burns.  

Page 144 

Method  

www.MyKashmir.in  

 

Add the turmeric, cumin and coriander and cook, still very gently, for a further 5 minutes. Don't burn the 

spices or the sauce will taste horrid - sprinkle on a few drops of water if you're worried.  

Take off the heat and cool a little. Put 4 fl oz cold water in a blender, add the contents of the pan and 

whizz until very smooth. Add the passata and stir.  

www.MyKashmir.in  

 

Put the puréed mixture back into the pan and cook for 20 - 30 minutes (the longer the better) over very 
low heat stirring occasionally. You can add a little hot water if it starts to catch on the pan but the 
idea is to gently "fry" the sauce which will darken in colour to an orangy brown. The final texture 
should be something like good tomato ketchup. Warning - it WILL gloop occasionally and splatter 
over your cooker, it's the price you have to pay!

hours in the fridge.

and spread over a large plate. This should keep the onions crispy. Once they have cooled crush the onions with 
your fingers and add this to the marinated meat mixture.

and add the washed rice and cook until the water boils. Once the water has boiled drain the rice in a colander 
and rinse with a little cold water.

rice evenly over the meat. Squeeze the lemon and pour the juice over the rice.Warm the milk and crush the 
safron into it. Pour the milf/safron mixture over the rice. Dot generously with ghee. To garnish spread the fried 
onions and corriander over the rice.  
Cover the saucepan tightly. Allow to steam on high heat for about 10 minutes and then lower the heat and 
cook for another 1 and a half to 2 hours. Before removing the pan from the cookeer ensure that there is no 
moisture left in the meat. This can be checked by simply listening for a sizling sound. If there is no sizzling 
then the Biryani is ready.

Abstract  

Culinary  practices  are  influenced  by  climate,  culture,  history  and  geography.  Molecular 
composition  of  recipes  in  a  cuisine  reveals  patterns  in  food  preferences.  Indian  cuisine 
encompasses a number of diverse sub-cuisines separated by geographies, climates and cultures. Its 
culinary system has a long history of health-centric dietary practices focused on disease prevention 
and promotion of health. We study food pairing in recipes of Indian cuisine to show that, in contrast 
to positive food pairing reported in some Western cuisines, Indian cuisine has a strong signature 
of negative food pairing;  more the extent of flavor sharing between any two ingredients,  lesser 
their co-occurrence. This feature is independent of recipe size and is not explained by ingredient 
category-based  recipe  constitution  alone.  Ingredient  frequency  emerged  as  the  dominant  factor 
specifying  the  characteristic  flavor  sharing  pattern  of  the  cuisine.  Spices,  individually  and  as  a 
category, form the basis of ingredient composition in Indian cuisine. We also present a culinary 
evolution model which reproduces ingredient use distribution as well as negative food pairing of 
the  cuisine.  Our  study  provides  a  basis  for  designing  novel  signature  recipes,  healthy  recipe 
alterations and recipe recommender systems. 

Introduction 

interplay  of  culture,  climate,  geography                                   

Culinary  practices  are  shaped  by  complex 
and  genetics  (1–6).  These  factors  influence  food  preferences  and  recipe  composition,  thereby 
altering  the  fabric  of  cuisine.  Recipe  composition  pattern  in  a  cuisine  provides  a  means  for 
investigating its gastronomic history and molecular constitution. The shift to cooked diet has been 
proposed  to  be  a  trigger  for  increased  brain  size  in  humans  (7).  Indian  culinary  system  has 
traditionally developed dietary practices where food has nutritional as well as medicinal value (8–
10). Ayurveda, the classic medicinal system of India, proposes that food has as much therapeutic 
value as drugs and even uses similar processing techniques for their preparation (11, 12).

In this study, we analyzed the recipe composition as well as flavor compound constitution of the 
Indian cuisine in search of its quintessential features. Specifically, we quantified the food pairing 
pattern and built models to identify features that explain statistical properties of the cuisine. The 
flavor constitution of the Indian cuisine was explored for ingredient composition and food pairing 
at the levels of cuisine, sub-cuisines, recipes and ingredient pairs. We built controls to probe for 
the  role  of  factors  that  may  be  crucial  in  shaping  recipes  and  hence  the  cuisine.  Further  we 
developed  models  to  explain  evolution  of  cuisine  and  its  characteristic  features.  Our  study 
illustrates application of data analysis and modeling for exploring chemical basis of a cuisine. 

 

Results 

The Indian cuisine. The traditional recipes of Indian cuisine are documented in the form of books 
(2)  and  lately  through  online  repositories.  We  compiled  the  recipes  data  from  TarlaDalal  (13) 
(http://www.tarladalal.com, November 2014), one of the largest, most extensive online repertoires 
of original Indian recipes (SI Text). After curation, the Indian cuisine contained 2543 recipes from 
following eight sub-cuisines: Bengali, Gujarati, Jain, Maharashtrian, Mughlai, Punjabi, Rajasthani 
and South  Indian. These sub-cuisines span diverse geographies, climates and cultures of Indian 
subcontinent. After aliasing ingredient names, the recipes comprised of 194 unique ingredients (SI 
Text and Dataset S1). The ingredients belong to following 15 categories: spice, vegetable, fruit, 
plant  derivative,  nut/seed,  cereal/crop,  dairy,  plant,  pulse,  herb,  meat,  fish/seafood,  beverage, 
animal product, and flower. Certain pulses (millets), lentils, spices and vegetables, seldom used in 
other cuisines, were common to Indian cuisine (SI Text). 

Recipe size distribution reflects the ingredient richness of recipes in the cuisine. Similar to other 
cuisines (4, 14, 15), the recipe size distribution of Indian cuisine is bounded, varying between 1 
and 40 with an average size of 7 (Fig. 1A). Mughlai sub-cuisine, with a royal lineage, had bimodal 
distribution with exceptionally large recipe sizes. Ingredient frequency when plotted against rank, 
by  ordering  ingredients  according  to  their  prevalence  in  the  cuisine,  reflects  bias  in  use  of 
ingredients.  The  frequency-rank  distribution  of  the  Indian  cuisine  varies  over  three  orders  of 
magnitude following a scale-free distribution (Fig. 1B). All sub-cuisines have strikingly similar 
profiles, indicative of generic culinary growth mechanisms (Fig 1B, inset). A few ingredients are 
excessively  used,  indicating  either  their  inherent  ‘fitness’  or  possible  accidental  lock-in  (15). 
Knowing that many cuisines share this property (4, 14, 15), the question is whether pattern of use 
of ingredients has any role in rendering the profile of a cuisine. 

Food pairing is measured in terms of overlap of flavor profiles. The composition of recipes in 
a cuisine could be studied in terms of co-occurrence of ingredients (14, 16). One of the notions 
associated with ingredient co-occurrence is positive food pairing hypothesis— ingredients sharing 
flavor compounds are more likely to taste well together than ingredients that do not (14, 17). While 
this  hypothesis  holds  true  for  some  cuisines  (North  American,  Western  European  and  Latin 
American), it does not hold for a few others (Southern European and East Asian) that have negative 
food  pairing  (14).  Thus,  beyond  following  generic  statistical  patterns  in  recipe  sizes  as  well  as 
ingredient use, skewed food pairing seems to be a unique feature representing molecular basis of 

 

2 

ingredient  combinations  dominant  in  a  cuisine.  Towards  the  aim  of  quantifying  the  pattern  of 
ingredient composition of recipes, we studied food pairing (sharing of flavor compounds) in Indian 
cuisine. 

While food sensation is a result of interplay between various aspects of ingredients, such as texture, 
color,  temperature  and  sound,  flavor  plays  a  dominant  role  in  specifying  culinary  fitness  of 
ingredients and their combinations (18, 19). Flavor mediated food perception, primarily involving 
molecular  interactions  with  olfactory  and  gustatory  receptors,  is  crucial  in  developing  food 
preferences in humans, and has coevolved with nutritional needs (20). Molecular composition of 
food dictates the sensation of flavor (21). Each ingredient is characterized by a set of chemical 
compounds which forms its flavor profile. Flavor profile provides us an effective tool for exploring 
patterns in ingredient composition of recipes. We obtained the flavor profiles for all ingredients in 
the Indian cuisine with the help of previously published data (14), a resource of flavor ingredients 
(21) and by extensive literature search (SI Text, Dataset S2). The flavor profiles, comprising of a 
total  of  1170  unique  compounds,  had  a  size  range  of  270.  Across  this  range  of  profile  size, 
ingredient category representation was fairly uniform (Fig. S1). 

The  interrelationship  among  ingredients  by  virtue  of  shared  flavor  compounds  could  be 
represented as a flavor graph that illustrates the underlying topology of flavor sharing (Fig. S2 and 
S3). The ingredients have dominant intra-category flavor sharing indicating significant overlap of 
𝑅) and 
flavor profiles within the category (Fig. S4).  We quantified flavor sharing in a recipe (𝑁𝑠
average flavor sharing of the cuisine (𝑁𝑠̅̅̅) by comparing profiles of ingredient pairs and their joint 
occurrence in recipes. Figure 2 illustrates this quantification procedure starting from data of recipes 
and flavor profiles 

Indian cuisine is characterized with strong negative food pairing. We found that average flavor 
sharing  in  Indian  cuisine  was  significantly  lesser  than  expected  by  chance  (Fig.  3A).  When 
computed for all recipes in the cuisine, average flavor sharing for Indian cuisine was found to be 
5.876, as compared to that of 9.442 for a randomized cuisine, which was constructed by randomly 
picking  the  ingredients  while  maintaining  the  recipe  size  distribution.  This  reflects  a  strong 
signature of non-random ingredient co-occurrence (∆𝑁𝑠 = 𝑁̅𝑠
𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑 = -3.566 and Z-score of 
-54.727) skewed towards negative food pairing (Fig.3B). This is corroborated by the pattern of 
extent of flavor sharing between pairs of ingredients and their co-occurrence in the cuisine (Fig. 
4A). More the extent of flavor sharing between any two ingredients in the Indian cuisine, lesser is 
their co-occurrence. The extent of food pairing bias in the Indian cuisine is much stronger than 
reported earlier for any other cuisine (14, 22) and is persistent regardless of the recipe size (Fig. 
3A). Our analysis also showed that each of the sub-cuisines independently displayed negative food 
pairing, highlighting it as an invariant feature of the Indian cuisine (Fig. 3B). Thus, we conclude 
that the Indian cuisine is characterized with a strong negative food pairing. 

𝐼𝐶 −   𝑁̅𝑠

We  further  explored  the  origin  of  this  characteristic  pattern  by  controlling  for  category  and 
frequency of use of ingredients. The former is a recipe-level control that generates a cuisine by 
preserving category composition of each recipe, whereas the latter is a cuisine-level control that 
generates  recipes  by  preserving  frequency  of  occurrence  of  each  ingredient.  Interestingly,  we 
observed that controlling only for the ingredient frequency leads to food pairing pattern similar to 

 

3 

that of real-world cuisine (Fig. 3A, Fig. S5 and Fig. 4B). On the other hand, controlling only for 
ingredient category led to a pattern similar to that of a randomized cuisine. A randomized control 
that  combines  category-composition  as  well  as  ingredient  frequency  also  reproduced  the  food 
pairing  pattern.  Thus,  ingredient  frequency  emerged  as  the  dominant  factor  specifying  the 
characteristic  flavor  sharing  pattern  of  the  Indian  cuisine.  Considering  the  biased  use  of 
ingredients, we investigated the role of top ranked ingredients by randomly swapping the top ten 
ingredients with the rest. We found that indeed the highly ranked ingredients play a key role in 
shaping the negative food pairing pattern of the cuisine, in contrast to ingredients with poor ranking 
(Fig. S6). 

A copy-mutate model of the Indian cuisine explains the negative ingredient pairing. Over the 
years, the present repertoire of recipes in Indian cuisine would have evolved from a much smaller 
primitive set of recipes. To probe for mechanisms and factors that may have influenced the cuisine, 
we  implemented  the  copy-mutate  model  proposed  by  Kinouchi  et.  al.(15).  This  model  imitates 
evolution of the cuisine to incorporate duplication and modification of recipes.  The model with 
randomly ascribed ingredient fitness reproduced the frequency-rank distribution (Fig. 5A), but had 
food  pairing  similar  to  a  random  cuisine  (𝑁𝑠̅̅̅  =  8.784,  Fig.  5C).  On  the  other  hand,  the  cuisine 
generated using a modified copy-mutate model, in which the ingredient fitness was scaled to its 
occurrence, acquired the characteristic  flavor sharing pattern  of real-world cuisine, reproducing 
the negative food pairing (𝑁𝑠̅̅̅ =  6.183, Fig. 5 C and D). Interestingly, our model also suggests that 
the pattern of frequency-rank distribution may be a persistent feature throughout the evolution of 
the cuisine, with presence of a few dominant ingredients (Fig. 5B). The fitness parameter in our 
model could represent ingredient availability, flavor, nutritional value, cost and versatility (15). 

Spices  are  uniquely  placed  in  the  recipes.  Negative  food  pairing  in  the  Indian  cuisine  is  a 
cumulative result of individual ingredient contributions by virtue of pairing with other ingredients 
in  recipes.  To  investigate  the  importance  of  individual  ingredients  and  their  categories  in  the 
composition  of  recipes,  we  randomized  ingredients  of  each  category  independently,  while 
maintaining the category as well as frequency of occurrence of the rest. We found that randomizing 
ingredients in any of the categories, except spices, does not affect negative food pairing pattern, 
thereby  implying  their  insignificance  (Fig.  6A).  Spices,  on  the  other  hand,  when  swapped 
𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑐𝑒 =  4.229 
selectively, randomize the negative food pairing significantly (Fig. 6A and B, ∆𝑁𝑠
and Z-score of -61.524). This  implies  that each of the spices is  uniquely placed in  its recipe to 
shape the flavor sharing pattern with rest of the ingredients, and is sensitive to replacement even 
with other spices, which is noteworthy given that the extent of flavor sharing is high among spices 
(Fig. S4 A). 

Spices  are  key  contributors  to  the  negative  ingredient  pairing.  Beyond  global  statistical 
features, we identified the ingredients  that make  key  contributions  towards the food pairing by 
computing the extent to which their presence affects the magnitude of average food pairing (𝜒) . 
We found that the key ingredients that contribute to negative food pairing of Indian cuisine were 
spices (Fig. 6C). Among the top ten ingredients whose presence bias flavor sharing pattern of the 
Indian cuisine towards negative pairing, nine were spices: cayenne, green bell pepper, coriander, 
garam masala, tamarind, ginger garlic paste, ginger, clove, and cinnamon (SI Text and Dataset S3).

We  surmise  that  this  pivotal  role  of  spices  carries  the  evidence  of  historical  practice  of  health-
centric diet in Indian subcontinent. 

Discussion. Our study reveals that spices occupy a unique position in the ingredient composition 
of Indian cuisine and play a major role in defining its characteristic profile. Spices, individually 
and  as  a  category,  emerged  as  the  most  critical  contributors  to  the  negative  food  pairing. 
Historically, they have been used as functional foods to serve multiple purposes such as coloring 
and flavoring agents, preservatives, and additives (23). Spices also find mention as medicines in 
Ayurveda  as  described  in  texts  such  as  Charaka  Samhita  (11,  12,  24).  One  of  the  strongest 
rationales for the use of spices is the antimicrobial hypothesis— spices are primarily used due to 
their activity against food spoilage bacteria (3, 25). A few of the most potent antimicrobial spices 
(26)  are  commonly  used  in  Indian  cuisine.  Spices  also  serve  as  antioxidant,  anti-inflammatory, 
chemopreventive, antimutagenic, and detoxifying agents (24, 27). Our recent studies have shown 
the beneficial role of capsaicin, an active component in cayenne which was revealed to be the most 
critical ingredient in rendering the food pairing of the cuisine (28). The significance of spices in 
Indian cuisine is also highlighted by the fact that its recipes have many derived ingredients that are 
spice  combinations  (SI  Text).  Archeological  evidences  have  suggested  to  the  fact  that  lentils, 
millets  and  spices,  especially  turmeric  and  garlic  were  used  as  ingredients  in  ancient  Indus 
civilizations (29, 30). We conclude that the evolution of cooking driven by medicinal beliefs would 
have left its signature on traditional Indian recipes. 

Traditionally, recipes have been passed down the generations via oral renditions. Documentation 
of recipes in the form of cookbooks enable preservation of culinary practices (2). Our copy-mutate 
model  of  culinary  evolution  incorporates  aspects  central  to  diversification  of  the  cuisine  and 
closely  reproduces  its  flavor  sharing  characteristics  at  the  level  of  cuisine,  recipes  as  well  as 
ingredient  pairs.  While  we  have  examined  Indian  cuisine  on  the  basis  of  one  of  the  most 
comprehensive resources, there is ample scope to enhance the analysis with enriched data. The 
flavor  profiles  of  ingredients  are  limited  by  the  availability  of  data.  Also,  our  study  does  not 
account for the fact that certain flavor compounds may undergo changes in the process of cooking. 
The study of molecular basis of the cuisine has potential to be extended into nutritional genomics 
to explore the role of dietary chemicals in health (31, 32). Beyond revealing the characteristic food 
pairing of  Indian cuisine, our study could  potentially lead to  methods for creating novel  Indian 
signature recipes, healthy recipe alterations and recipe recommender systems. 

Methods 

Flavor sharing. We enumerated the  flavor sharing  (14) pattern among the ingredients  that  co-
occur in a recipe, starting from the set of 2,543  (𝑁𝑅) traditional Indian recipes comprising of 194 
𝑅 
(𝑁𝐼) ingredients (SI Text). We computed average number of shared compounds in each recipe 𝑁𝑠
and  further  calculated  a  representative  average  flavor  sharing  index  𝑁𝑠̅̅̅ (= ∑ 𝑁𝑠
  of  the 
cuisine. Figure 2 presents a graphic illustration of this procedure. For a recipe R with n ingredients 
𝑁𝑠

𝑅 is defined as,

where 𝐹𝑖 represents the flavor profile of ingredient 𝑖 (a set of compounds). 

𝐼𝐶 −   𝑁̅𝑠

Average flavor sharing in Indian cuisine was compared with a corresponding randomized cuisine 
to  assess  its  statistical  relevance  by  computing  ∆𝑁𝑠 = 𝑁̅𝑠
𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑,  where  ‘IC’  and  ‘Rand’ 
indicate Indian cuisine and corresponding random cuisine, respectively. Five types of randomized 
cuisines were created by maintaining the recipe size distribution of the original Indian cuisine: a 
randomized  control  where  ingredients  were  chosen  uniformly  (20,000  recipes);  a  frequency-
preserved  control  in  which  frequency  of  use  of  ingredients  was  preserved  (20,000  recipes);  a 
category-preserved control in which while the category composition of the recipe was preserved, 
ingredients  were  randomly  chosen  from  each  constituent  category  (8  sets  of  control  cuisines, 
20,344 recipes); a frequency-and-category-preserved control where the category composition was 
maintained and each ingredient was chosen with probability consistent with its frequency in Indian 
cuisine  (8  sets  of  control  cuisines,  20,344  recipes);  a  frequency-preserved  randomized  control 
where the top 10 ranked ingredients in the Indian cuisine were randomly swapped with low ranked 
(rank ≥ 11) ingredients (10 sets of control cuisines, 200,000 recipes). The statistical significance 

of  ∆Ns was measured with Z-score, 𝑍 = √𝑁𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑

𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑)

 . Here  NRand and 𝜎𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑 represent 

total number of recipes in the randomized cuisine and standard deviation, respectively. 

Copy-mutate  model.  Copy-mutate  model  (15)  imitates  evolution  of  a  cuisine  to  incorporate 
duplication and modification of recipes. It was started with an initial set of recipes (𝑅0 = 20) of 
size 𝐾 (= 7) each, by random selection of ingredients from a randomly populated ingredient pool. 
This initial set was evolved by copying a recipe randomly, mutating it 𝐿(= 2) times and adding 
this mutated recipe back to the set. For every mutation an ingredient was randomly chosen from 
the recipe and was replaced with another ingredient chosen randomly from the pool, only if the 
latter had higher fitness value than the former. New ingredients were introduced for maintaining 
the  size  ratio  of  ingredient  pool  and  recipe  pool  (𝑀 = 0.0762,  consistent  with  that  of  Indian 
cuisine).  This  process  was  repeated  to  obtain  61,032  recipes  comprising  24  sets  of  cuisines 
generated through copy-mutate model. While one of the models was implemented with the strategy 
of Kinouchi et. al. (15) with randomly ascribed fitness values to ingredients (‘fitness random’), a 
derivative  of  the  same  had  fitness  values  scaled  to  ingredient  frequency  in  the  Indian  cuisine 
(‘fitness ranked’). 

Ingredient  uniqueness.  Uniqueness  of  an  ingredient  of  a  given  category  by  virtue  of  flavor 
sharing pattern with other ingredients in the recipe was computed by replacing it with a randomly 
chosen  ingredient  from  the  same  category.  Deviation  in  the  average  flavor  sharing  of  the 
randomized recipes (8 sets of control cuisines, 20,344 recipes) from that of the original cuisine 
was measured, for 10 major categories (depicted in Fig. S4).

Fig. 3. Strong negative food pairing in Indian cuisine and constituent sub-cuisines. (A) The 
Indian cuisine is characterized by strong negative flavor sharing, when compared to its random 
control. The pattern of negative food pairing is independent of the recipe size (𝑠) and is statistically 
significant. While all 2,543 recipes are included for enumeration at cut-off of two, only around 3% 
(80) and 0.6% (15) recipes are considered at cut-off of 15 and 20, respectively. While the recipes 
set controlled only for ingredient category did not explain the negative food pairing, controlling 
for frequency of use of ingredient reproduces the characteristic profile. (B) Strong negative food 
pairing emerged as an invariant feature of all sub-cuisines as measured in terms of average food 
pairing and its statistical significance.

tend to have similar flavor profiles within the category (Fig. S4). Spices are uniquely placed in the

1.1 Data source selection 
Our  data  on  Indian  cuisine  was  obtained  from  one  of  the  leading  cookery  websites  in  India, 
tarladalal.com.  Among  the  various  online  resources  available  for  recipes  from  Indian  cuisines, 
TarlaDalal  (http://www.tarladalal.com)  was  found  to  be  the  best  in  terms  of  authentic  recipes, 
cuisine annotations and coverage across major regional subtypes. The website has 3330 recipes 
from 
Sanjeev  Kapoor 
(http://www.sanjeevkapoor.com)  has  3399  recipes  from  23  Indian  cuisines.  NDTV  Cooks 
(http://cooks.ndtv.com)  has  667  Indian  recipes  across  15  cuisines.  Manjula’s  Kitchen 
(http://www.manjulaskitchen.com)  is  restricted  to  730  Indian  vegetarian  recipes  across  19  food 
categories.  Recipes Indian (http://www.recipesindian.com) has 891 recipes from around 16 food 
categories. All Recipes (http://www.allrecipes.com) has only 449 recipes from 6 food categories. 
In comparison to these sources, Tarladalal.com is the best source of recipes for Indian cuisine. The

1.2. Data collection and curation: Recipes 

We  started  with  the  data  containing  3330  recipes.  This  number  was  reduced  after  pruning  to 
remove duplicates and other inconsistencies, to obtain 3037 recipes. Recipes containing any of the 
ingredients for which no flavor profile was available (349) were removed from the data, leaving 
us  with  2688  recipes.  For  the  purpose  of  flavor  sharing  analysis,we  removed  ingredients  from 
‘snack’  and  ‘additive’  categories,  as  their  flavor  profiles  could  not  be  determined.  Finally,  all 
recipes having single ingredient were removed to obtain a final set of 2543 recipes.  

 

The Indian cuisine from TarlaDalal comprise of 588 ingredients. For the purpose of mapping the 
ingredients  to  their  flavor  profiles  (list  of  volatileflavor  compounds  present  in  that  ingredient), 
these ingredient names were aliased to 339 source ingredients. These ingredients were categorised 
into seventeen ingredient categories based on the nature of ingredients. Out of these 339 aliased 
ingredients, we could obtain flavor profiles for 194 ingredients. By aliasing we mean, removing 
the redundant terms in ingredient names. For instance, canned pineapple was aliased as pineapple. 
Ingredient names in Hindi  were translated to English.  For instance  anardaana  was  renamed  as 
pomegranate. Further we aliased some of the ingredient names for the purpose of matching our 
ingredient names with their data. For instance bay leaf was named bay laurel. By crosschecking 
with dataset of Ahn et al (1), ingredients unique to Indian cuisine were identified. A full list of 
ingredient aliases, their categories and other details are provided in Dataset S1.

1.3. Compilation of the flavor profiles data 

Our data of Indian cuisine as well as flavor compounds is not exhaustive. The original ingredient 
number had to be drastically reduced as flavor profiles of some of the ingredients could not be 
identified. Our main source of flavor compounds was obtained from the data made available by 
Ahn et al(1). Out of 194 ingredients with flavor profiles, 146 were obtained from dataset of Ahn 
et al(1). Ingredients for which the flavor data could not be obtained from either of these sources 
(31), flavor profile were compiled by extensive literature survey. All the flavor profiles were cross 
checked with those in 6th edition (latest) of Fenaroli’s Handbook of Flavor Compounds (2) so that 
their names are used consistently. Chemical Abstract Service numbers were also used as unique 
identifiers to bring consistency in nomenclature of flavor molecules. Detailed information of all 
the ingredients and their flavor profile are provided in Dataset S2.

FOREWORD

- Dr. C. GOPALAN
Founder President 
Nutrition Foundation of India

It is now more than a decade since this valuable publication was first prepared. 
It  was  compiled  by  a  team  of  experienced  nutrition  scientists  at  the  National 
Institute  of  Nutrition,  Hyderabad,  under  the  leadership  of  Dr.  Kamala 
Krishnaswamy. It has received wide appreciation from the general public as well as 
from students of nutrition, medicine, home science, nursing and allied subjects, and 
has been reprinted several times. It has also been widely disseminated through 
outreach activities undertaken by the National Institute of Nutrition, in the form of 
lectures, exhibitions and distribution of materials in various local languages.

In the intervening years, there have been notable socio-economic changes in 
India.  It  was  thought  necessary  to  update  the  guidelines  in  the  light  of  new 
developments and fresh information.

The most notable change has been in the overall economic scenario in the 
country,  with  a  robust  growth  rate.  There  have  also  been  some  important 
government initiatives in the fields of health and nutrition and poverty alleviation, 
including the launching of MGNREGA and overhauling of the ICDS. Globalisation 
has  resulted  in  the  opening  of  multinational  fast  food  chains  in  Indian  cities, 
including the smaller cities. Lifestyles and dietary patterns that had started giving 
early  warning  signals  towards  the  end  of  the  previous  century,  when  these 
guidelines were first published, are continuing to follow a trend that promotes 
obesity and the attendant non communicable diseases.

The improvement in the overall economy at the macro level and concomitant 
improvements  in  purchasing  power  (though  unevenly  distributed)  among 
households have not led to the expected levels of improvement in the nutritional 
status of Indians. The latest findings of the National Family Health Survey, NFHS-3 
showed  virtually  no  improvement  in  parameters  as  compared  to  NFHS-2,  and 
recent surveys by the National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau have thrown more 
light  on  the  growing  problem  of  the  'double  burden'  of  undernutrition  and 
overnutrition. These data should serve as a wake-up call to nutritionists and policy 
makers.  There  is  very  obviously  an  'awareness  and  information  deficit',  even 
among the more affluent sections of the population, about good dietary practices 
and their linkage with good health. This deficit should be narrowed and eliminated 
by  harnessing  all  traditional  as  well  as  modern  technological  vehicles  of 
communication.

This updated version of DGI from India's premier nutrition institute, National 
Institute of Nutrition, should serve as a valuable source of concise, accurate and 
accessible information, both for members of the general public and those who are 
involved in dissemination of nutrition and health education. 

PREFACE

The first edition of 'Dietary Guidelines' was published in 1998, and since then 
many  changes  have  taken  place  in  the  country.  The  economic  transition  has 
transformed the way people live. Changing lifestyles of people both in rural and 
urban areas are seen to alter the very structure of our society at a rapid pace today. 
The shift from traditional to 'modern' foods, changing cooking practices, increased 
intake of processed and ready-to-eat foods, intensive marketing of junk foods and 
'health' beverages have affected people's perception of foods as well as their dietary 
behaviour. Irrational preference for energy-dense foods and those with high sugar 
and salt content pose a serious health risk to the people, especially children. The 
increasing  number  of  overweight  and  obese  people  in  the  community  and  the 
resulting  burden  of  chronic  non-communicable  diseases  necessitate  systematic 
nutrition educational interventions on a massive scale. There is a need for adoption 
of  healthy  dietary  guidelines  along  with  strong  emphasis  on  regular  physical 
exercise.

Today, the multiple sources of health and nutrition related information tend to 
create unnecessary confusion among people. This book makes an attempt to inform 
us on matters of everyday nutrition in a user friendly manner and thus, aims to 
influence our dietary behavior. These guidelines deal with nutritional requirements 
of people during all stages of their life, right from infancy to old age.

We earnestly hope that readers will enjoy reading the book and benefit from it 

and also spread the valuable information among those around them.

INTRODUCTION

Nutrition is a basic human need and a prerequisite to a healthy life. A proper 
diet is essential from the very early stages of life for proper growth, development 
and to remain active. Food consumption, which largely depends on production and 
distribution, determines the health and nutritional status of the population. The 
recommended  dietary  allowances  (RDA)  are  nutrient-centred  and    technical  in 
nature. Apart from supplying nutrients, foods provide a host of other components 
(non-nutrient  phytochemicals)  which  have  a  positive  impact  on  health.  Since 
people consume food, it is essential to advocate nutrition in terms of foods, rather 
than nutrients. Emphasis has, therefore, been shifted from a nutrient orientation to 
the food-based approach for attaining optimal nutritional status. Dietary guidelines 
are a translation of scientific knowledge on nutrients into specific dietary advice. 
They represent the recommended dietary allowances of nutrients in terms of diets 
that should be consumed by the population. The guidelines promote the concept of 
nutritionally adequate diets and healthy lifestyles from the time of conception to old 
age. 

Formulation of dietary goals and specific guidelines would help in providing 
required  guidance  to  people  in  ensuring  nutritional  adequacy.  The  dietary 
guidelines could be directly applied for general population or specific physiological 
or high risk groups to derive health benefits. They may also be used by medical and 
health personnel, nutritionists and dietitians. The guidelines are consistent with the 
goals set in national policies on Agriculture, Health and Nutrition.

The dietary guidelines ought to be practical, dynamic and flexible, based on the 
prevailing situation. Their utility is influenced by the extent to which they reflect the 
social,  economic, agricultural and other environmental conditions. The guidelines 
can be considered as an integral component of the country's comprehensive plan to 
reach the goals specified in the National Nutrition Policy. 

The  major  food  issues  of  concern  are  insufficient/  imbalanced  intake  of 
foods/nutrients. The common nutritional problems of public health importance in 
India are low  birth weight, protein energy malnutrition in children, chronic energy 
deficiency  in  adults,  micronutrient  malnutrition  and  diet-related  non-
communicable diseases. However, diseases at the either end of the spectrum of 

nutrition

malnutrition (under
 and overnutrition) are important. Recent evidences 
indicate  that  undernutrition  in  utero  may  set  the  pace  for  diet-related    chronic 
diseases  in  later  life.  Population  explosion,  demographic  changes,  rapid 
urbanization and alterations in traditional habits contribute to the development of 
certain unhealthy dietary practices and physical inactivity, resulting in diet-related 
chronic diseases. 

The  dietary  guidelines  emphasize  promotion  of  health  and  prevention  of 
disease,  of  all  age  groups  with  special  focus  on  vulnerable  segments  of  the 
population  such  as  infants,  children  and  adolescents,  pregnant  and  lactating 
women  and  the  elderly.  Other  related  factors,  which  need  consideration  are 
physical activity, health care, safe water supply and socio-economic development, 
all of which strongly influence nutrition and health.

In this document, food-related approaches, both in qualitative and quantitative 
terms, have been incorporated. Emphasis is on positive recommendations which 
can  maximize  protective  effects  through  use  of  a  variety  of  foods  in  tune  with 
traditional habits.  The higher goals set with respect to certain food items such as 
pulses, milk and vegetables/fruits are intended to encourage appropriate policy 
decisions. Suitable messages for each of these guidelines have been highlighted.

A variety of foods, which are available and are within the reach of the common 
man, can be selected to formulate nutritionally adequate diets. While there are only 
four accepted basic food groups, in India, there are a variety of food preparations 
and culinary practices.  Different cereals/millets are used as staple food, apart from 
a variety of cereal/millet/pulse combinations in different regions of India. The 
cooking oils and fat used are of several kinds.   The proposed guidelines help to 
formulate  health  promoting  recipes  and  diets  which  are  region-  and  culture-
specific. It is difficult to compute standard portion sizes, common to all regions of 
India. Nevertheless, attempts are made to give portion sizes and exchanges.  

Translation of knowledge into action calls for the coordinated efforts of several 
government and non-government organizations. The fifteen guidelines prescribed, 
herein, stress on adequacy of intake of foods from all food groups for maintenance 
of  optimal  health.  Effective  IEC  strategies  and  other  large-scale  educational 
campaigns  should  be  launched  to  encourage  people  to  follow  the  dietary 
guidelines. Such efforts should be integrated with the existing national nutrition
and health programs.

CURRENT DIET AND NUTRITION SCENARIO

th

      Health  and  nutrition  are  the  most  important  contributory  factors  for  human 
resource development in the country.  India has been classified by the World Bank 
as a country with a lower middle income, with per capita GNP of US $ 996-3945 . It 
ranks 160  in terms of human development among 209 countries. Among the Indian 
population, about 28% in the rural and 26% in the urban areas are estimated to be 
below the poverty line , which is defined as the expenditure needed to obtain, on an 
average, 2400 Kcal per capita per day in the rural areas and 2100 Kcal in urban 
areas. Long-term malnutrition leads to stunting and wasting, non-communicable 
chronic  diet  related  disorders,  increased  morbidity  and  mortality  and  reduced 
physical work output. It is a great economic loss to the country and undermines 
development. 
Common Nutrition Problems
      Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM), micronutrient deficiencies such as vitamin A 
deficiency (VAD) , Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA), Iodine Deficiency Disorders(IDD) 
and  vitamin  B-complex  deficiencies  are  the  nutrition  problems  frequently 
encountered, particularly among the rural poor and urban slum  communities.
      Undernutrition  starts  as  early  as  during  conception.  Because  of  extensive 
maternal  undernutrition  (underweight,  poor  weight  gain  during  pregnancy, 
nutritional anaemia and vitamin deficiencies), about 22% of the infants are born with 
low  birth-weight  (<2500  g) ,  as  compared  to  less  than  10%  in  the  developed 
countries. Both clinical and sub-clinical undernutrition are widely prevalent even 
during early childhood and adolescence. Though the prevalence of florid forms of 
severe PEM like kwashiorkor and marasmus among preschool children is <1 %, 
national surveys indicate that about half of (48%) <5 year children suffer from sub-
clinical undernutrition such as underweight (43%) stunting and wasting (20%) which 
indicates that undernutrition is of long duration . The studies have shown that there 
is a steep increase in the prevalence of underweight with increase of age, from 27% 
at 6 months of age to a high of 45% at 24 months of age . This is attributable to faulty 
infant and young child feeding practices prevailing in the community.

Persistent undernutrition throughout the growing phase of childhood leads to 
short stature in adults.  About 33% of adult men and 36% of the women have a Body 
Mass  Index  (BMI)  [Weight  in  kg/(Height  in  meter) ]  below  18.5,  which  indicates 
Chronic Energy Deficiency or CED (Table1) . In the case of vitamin A deficiency, 0.8- 
1%  of  preschool  children  show  the  signs  of  Bitot's  spots  and  night  blindness.   
Vitamin A deficiency also increases the risk of disease and death.

Among children between the ages of 6 and 59 months, a majority (70%)  are 
anemic. Nearly three fourth (75%) of women in India are anemic, with the prevalence 
of moderate to severe anemia being highest (50%) among pregnant women . It is 
estimated  that  nutritional  anemia  contributes  to  about  24%   of  maternal  deaths 
every year and is one of the important causes of low birth weight.  It adversely affects 
work output among adults and learning ability in children.

Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) are very common among large sections of 
population in several parts of the country.   About 167 million are estimated to be 
living in IDD endemic areas.  Iodine deficiency causes goiter (enlargement of thyroid 
gland in the neck), neonatal hypothyroidism, cretinism among new borns, mental 
retardation, delayed motor development, stunting, deaf-mutism and neuromuscular 
disorders.  The  most  important  consequence  of  iodine  deficiency  in  mothers  is 
cretinism in which the children suffer from mental and growth retardation right from 
the birth. About 90,000 still-births and neonatal deaths occur every year due to 
maternal iodine deficiency.  Around 54 million persons are estimated to have goiter, 
2.2 million have cretinism and 6.6 million suffer from mild psycho-motor handicaps .

7

India is passing through the phase of economic transition and while the problem 
of undernutrition continues to be a major problem, prevalence of overnutrition is 
emerging as a significant problem, especially in the urban areas. The prevalence of 
overweight/ obesity is higher among the women (10.9%) compared to men (7.8%) in 
rural  areas . The  prevalence  of  Diabetes  Mellitus   and  Coronary  Heart  Disease 
(CHD)  is also higher in urban areas as compared to their rural counterparts. The 
incidence rate of cancer is comparatively higher among women (123) compared to 
men (113 for 100,000) .

The  overall  production  of  food  grains  (cereals/millets/pulses)  recorded  a 
significant increase from about 108 million tones in 1970-71 to a little over 230 million 
tones during 2007-2008
. Though the production of cereals and millets appears to 
be adequate, production of pulses, the source of protein for the rural poor, actually 
shows a decline.  Total Production of vegetables is about 30% less than the demand 
of 100 million tones . The total production of milk during 2006-2007 was about 100.9 
million tones,  corresponding to about 245 g per caput per day, which is lower than 
the world average of 285 g per day . Though the per capita availability of various 
foods  stuffs  is  comparable  to  RDA,  the  distribution  of  foods,  both  within  the 
community and the family, may be unfavorable to some vulnerable groups due to low 
income and purchasing power.  In view of the high cost of milk, a large proportion of 
the Indian population subsists on diets consisting mostly of plant foods with low 
nutrient bio-availability (Table 2).

National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB) surveys  indicate that the daily 
intake of all foods except cereals and millets (396g) in Indian households is lower 
than  the  Recommended  Dietary  Allowances  or  RDA  (Table  3).  The  average 
consumption of pulses and legumes like green gram, bengal gram and black gram, 
which are important source of protein was less than 50% of RDA.  Consumption of 
green leafy vegetables (<14g) and other vegetables (43 g), which are rich sources of 
micronutrients like beta-carotene, folate, calcium, riboflavin and iron  was  grossly 
inadequate. Intake of visible fat was also less than 50% of the RDA.

The proportion of households with energy inadequacy was about 70%, while that 
with protein inadequacy was about 27%. Thus, in the cereal/millet-based Indian 
dietaries, the primary bottleneck is energy inadequacy and not the protein, as was 
earlier believed. This dietary energy gap can be easily reduced by the poor by 
increasing the quantities of habitually eaten foods.

On the other side of the spectrum of malnutrition, diet-related non-communi-
cable diseases are commonly seen. With increasing urbanization, energy-rich diets 
containing higher amount of fat and sugar, which also provide less dietary fibre and 
complex  carbohydrates,  are  being  frequently  consumed,  particularly  by  high-
income groups.  In addition, the urban population is turning to be more sedentary 
with little physical activity. Consumption of alcohol, providing empty calories, and 
tobacco use is also common among them. Hence, prevalence of disorders like 
obesity, heart disease, hypertension (high blood pressure) diabetes and certain 
types of cancers is on the increase.

Determinants of Malnutrition

Widespread  malnutrition  is  largely  a  result  of  dietary  inadequacy  and 
unhealthy lifestyles. Other contributing factors are poor purchasing power, faulty 
feeding habits, large family size, frequent infections, poor health care, inadequate 
sanitation and low agricultural production. Population living in the backward and 
drought-prone rural areas and urban slums, and those belonging to the socially 
backward  groups  like  scheduled  castes  and  tribal  communities  are  highly 
susceptible to undernutrition. Similarly, landless labourers and destitutes are also at 
a higher risk.

The  most  rational,  sustainable  and  long-term  solution  to  the  problem  of 
malnutrition  is  ensuring  availability,  accessability  and  consumption  of  adequate 
amounts  of  foods.  Dietary  guidelines  help  to  achieve  the  objective  of  providing 
optimal nutrition to the population.

Eat variety of foods to ensure a balanced diet

Guideline 1

Rationale: Nutritionally adequate diet should be consumed through a 

wise choice from a variety of foods

vNutrition is a basic prerequisite to sustain life. 
vVariety in food is not only the spice of life but also the essence of nutrition and 

health.

vA diet consisting of foods from several food groups provides all the required 

nutrients in proper amounts. 

vCereals, millets and pulses are major sources of most nutrients. 
vMilk which provides good quality proteins and calcium must be an essential 

item of the diet, particularly for infants, children and women. 

vOils and nuts are calorie-rich foods, and are useful for increasing the energy 

density  and quality of food. 

vInclusion of eggs, flesh foods and fish enhances the quality of diet. However, 
vegetarians can derive almost all the nutrients from diets consisting of cereals, 
pulses, vegetables, fruits and milk-based diets.

vVegetables  and  fruits  provide  protective  substances  such  as  vitamins/ 

minerals/ phytonutrients.

vDiversified diets with a judicious choice from a variety food groups provide the 

necessary nutrients.

Why do we need nutritionally adequate food? 

Nutrients that we obtain through food have vital effects on physical growth and 
development, maintenance of normal body function, physical activity and health. 
Nutritious food is, thus needed to sustain life and activity. Our diet must provide all 
essential nutrients in the required amounts. Requirements of essential nutrients 
vary with age, gender, physiological status and physical activity. Dietary intakes 
lower or higher than the body requirements can lead to undernutrition (deficiency 
diseases) or overnutrition (diseases of affluence) respectively. Eating too little food 
during certain significant periods of life such as infancy, childhood, adolescence, 
pregnancy  and  lactation  and  eating  too  much  at  any  age  can  lead  to  harmful 
consequences. An adequate diet, providing all nutrients, is needed throughout our 
lives. The nutrients must be obtained through a judicious choice and combination of 
a variety of foodstuffs from different food groups (Figure 1).  

11

EAT SPARINGLYEAT LIBERALLYEAT MODERATELYCONSUME ADEQUATELYCarbohydrates, fats and proteins are macronutrients, which are needed in large 
amounts. Vitamins and minerals constitute the micronutrients and are required in 
small amounts. These nutrients are necessary for physiological and biochemical 
processes  by  which  the  human  body  acquires,  assimilates  and  utilizes  food  to 
maintain health and activity.  
Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are either simple or complex, and are major sources of energy in 
all  human  diets.  They  provide  energy  of  4  Kcal/g.  The  simple  carbohydrates, 
glucose and fructose, are found in fruits, vegetables and honey, sucrose in sugar 
and lactose in milk, while the complex polysaccharides are starches in cereals, 
millets, pulses and root vegetables and glycogen in animal foods. The other complex 
carbohydrates  which  are  resistant  to  digestion  in  the  human  digestive  tract  are 
cellulose in vegetables and whole grains, and gums and pectins in vegetables, fruits 
and cereals, which constitute the dietary fibre component. In India, 70-80% of total 
dietary  calories  are  derived  from  carbohydrates  present  in  plant  foods  such  as 
cereals, millets and pulses.  

Dietary  fibre  delays  and  retards  absorption  of  carbohydrates  and  fats  and 
increases the satiety value. Diets rich in fibre reduce glucose and lipids in blood and 
increase the bulk of the stools. Diets rich in complex carbohydrates are healthier 
than low-fibre diets based on refined and processed foods.
Proteins

Proteins are primary structural and functional components of every living cell. 
Almost half the protein in our body is in the form of muscle and the rest of it is in bone, 
cartilage and skin. Proteins are complex molecules composed of different amino 
acids. Certain amino acids which are termed “essential”, have to be obtained from 
proteins in the diet since they are not synthesized in the human body. Other non-
essential amino acids can be synthesized in the body to build proteins. Proteins 
perform a wide range of functions and also provide energy (4 Kcal/g).  

Protein  requirements  vary  with  age,  physiological  status  and  stress.  More 
proteins  are  required  by  growing  infants  and  children,  pregnant  women  and 
individuals during infections and illness or stress. Animal foods like milk, meat, fish 
and eggs and plant foods such as pulses and legumes are rich sources of proteins. 
Animal proteins are of high quality as they provide all the essential amino acids in 
right  proportions,  while  plant  or  vegetable  proteins  are  not  of  the  same  quality 
because of their low content of some of the essential amino acids. However, a 
combination of cereals, millets and pulses provides most of the amino acids, which 
complement each other to provide better quality proteins.    

13

Fats

Oils and fats such as butter, ghee and vanaspathi constitute dietary visible fats. 
Fats are a concentrated source of energy providing 9 Kcal/g, and are made up of 
fatty acids in different proportions.  Dietary fats are derived from two sources viz. the 
invisible fat present in plant and animal foods; and the visible or added fats  and oils 
(cooking oil). Fats serve as a vehicle for fat-soluble vitamins like vitamins A, D, E and 
K and carotenes and promote their absorption. They are also sources of essential 
polyunsaturated fatty acids. It is necessary to have adequate and good quality fat in 
the diet with sufficient polyunsaturated fatty acids in proper proportions for meeting 
the requirements of essential fatty acids (Refer chapter 7).  The type and quantity of 
fat in the daily diet influence the level of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood. 
Diets should include adequate amounts of fat particularly in the case of infants and 
children,  to  provide  concentrated  energy  since  their  energy  needs  per  kg  body 
weight are nearly twice those of adults. Adults need to be cautioned to restrict intake 
of saturated fat (butter, ghee and hydrogenated fats) and cholesterol (red meat, 
eggs, organ meat). Excess of these substances could lead to obesity, diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease and cancer. 
Vitamins and minerals

thiamin  (B ),

Vitamins are chemical compounds required by the body in small amounts. They 
must be present in the diet as they cannot be synthesized in the body. Vitamins are 
essential for numerous body processes and for maintenance of the structure of skin, 
bone, nerves, eye, brain, blood and mucous membrane. They are either water-
soluble or fat-soluble. Vitamins A, D, E and K are fat-soluble, while vitamin C, and the 
B-complex  vitamins  such  as 
riboflavin  (B ),  niacin,  pyridoxine  (B ),  folic 
acid and cyanocobalamin (B ) are water-
soluble. Pro-vitamin like beta-carotene 
is converted to vitamin A in the body. 
Fat-soluble vitamins can be stored in 
the body while water-soluble vitamins 
are not and get easily excreted in urine. 
Vitamins  B-complex  and  C  are  heat 
labile vitamins and are easily destroyed 
by heat, air or during drying, cooking 
and food processing.  

Food Groups

12

Minerals  are 

inorganic  elements 

found  in  body  fluids  and  tissues.  The 
important  macro  minerals  are  sodium, 

14

potassium,  calcium,  phosphorus,  magnesium  and  sulphur,  while  zinc,  copper, 
selenium, molybdenum, fluorine, cobalt, chromium and iodine are micro minerals. 
They are required for maintenance and integrity of skin, hair, nails, blood and soft 
tissues. They  also  govern  nerve  cell  transmission,  acid/base  and  fluid  balance, 
enzyme and hormone activity as well as the blood- clotting processes. Approximate 
calorific value of nuts, salads and fruits are given in annexure 1.
What is a balanced diet?

A balanced diet is one which provides all the nutrients in required amounts and 
proper proportions. It can easily be achieved through a blend of the four basic food 
groups.  The quantities of foods needed to meet the nutrient requirements vary with 
age,  gender,  physiological  status  and  physical  activity.  A  balanced  diet  should 
provide  around  50-60%  of  total  calories  from  carbohydrates,  preferably  from 
complex carbohydrates, about 10-15% from proteins and 20-30% from both visible 
and invisible fat.

In addition, a balanced diet should provide other non-nutrients such as dietary 
fibre,  antioxidants  and  phytochemicals  which  bestow  positive  health  benefits. 
Antioxidants  such  as  vitamins  C  and  E,  beta-carotene,  riboflavin  and  selenium 
protect the human body from free radical damage. Other phytochemicals such as 
polyphenols, flavones, etc., also afford protection against  oxidant damage. Spices 
like turmeric, ginger, garlic, cumin and  cloves are rich in antioxidants. Balanced Diet 
for Adults - Sedentary/Moderate/Heavy Activity is given in annexure 2 and figures 3 
& 4. Also, sample menu plans for sedentary adult man and woman are   given in 
annexure 2a and 2b respectively.
What are food groups ?

Foods are conventionally grouped as :  
1.Cereals, millets and pulses 
3.Milk and milk products, egg, meat and fish 4.Oils & fats and nuts & oilseeds 

2.Vegetables and fruits 

However, foods may also be classified according to their functions (Table 4). 
What are nutrient requirements and recommended dietary allowances (RDA)?
Requirements are the quantities of nutrients that healthy individuals must obtain 
from food to meet their physiological needs. The recommended dietary allowances 
(RDAs) are estimates of nutrients to be consumed daily to ensure the requirements 
of all individuals in a given population. The recommended level depends upon the 
bioavailability of nutrients from a given diet. The term bioavailability indicates what is 
absorbed and utilized by the body. In addition, RDA includes a margin of safety, to 
cover variation between individuals, dietary traditions and practices. The RDAs are 

15

suggested  for  physiological  groups  such  as  infants,  pre-schoolers,  children, 
adolescents, pregnant women, lactating mothers, and adult men and women, taking 
into  account  their  physical  activity.  In  fact,  RDAs  are  suggested  averages/day. 
However,  in  practice,  fluctuations  in  intake  may  occur  depending  on  the  food 
availability and demands of the body. But, the average requirements need to be 
satisfied over a period of time (Annexure-3). 

Our diet must provide adequate calories, proteins and micronutrients to achieve 
maximum growth potential. Therefore, it is important to have appropriate diet during 
different stages of one’s life (Figure 2). There may be situations where adequate 
amounts of nutrients may not be available through diet alone. In such high risk 
situations  where  specific  nutrients  are  lacking,  foods  fortified  with  the  limiting 
nutrient(s) become necessary. A good example of such fortified foods is the salt 
fortified with iron and iodine.

Guideline 2

Ensure provision of extra food and healthcare to 

pregnant and lactating women

Rationale:

Additional  food  and  extra  care  are  required  during 
pregnancy and lactation

?Pregnancy is physiologically and nutritionally a highly demanding period. Extra 

food is required to meet the requirements of the fetus.

?A woman prepares herself to meet the nutritional demands by increasing her 

own body fat deposits during pregnancy.

?A lactating mother requires extra food to secrete adequate quantity/ quality of 

milk and to safe guard her own health. 

Why additional diet is required during pregnancy and lactation ?

Pregnancy is a demanding physiological state.  In India, it is observed that diets 
of women from the low socioeconomic groups are essentially similar during pre-
pregnant,  pregnant  and  lactating  periods.  Consequently,  there  is  widespread 
maternal malnutrition leading to high prevalence of low birth weight 
infants and very high maternal mortality. Additional foods are required 
to improve weight gain in pregnancy (10-12 Kg) and birth weight of 
infants (about 3 Kg). 
What are the nutrients that require special attention ?

throughout 

the  pregnancy,  reduces 

The daily diet of a woman should contain an additional 350 
calories, 0.5 g of protein during first trimester and 6.9 g during 
second  trimester  and  22.7  g  during  third  trimester  of 
pregnancy.  Some  micronutrients  are  specially  required  in 
extra amounts during these physiological periods. Folic acid, 
taken 
the  risk  of 
congenital malformations and increases the birth weight. The 
mother as well as the growing fetus needs iron to meet the high 
demands  of  erythropoiesis  (RBC  formation).  Calcium  is 
essential,  both  during  pregnancy  and  lactation,  for  proper 
formation of bones and teeth of the offspring, for secretion of 
breast-milk rich in calcium and to prevent osteoporosis in the 
mother.  Similarly,  iodine  intake  ensures  proper  mental 
health of the growing fetus and infant. Vitamin A is required 

21

survival. Besides these, nutrients like vitamins B  12

during lactation to improve child 
and C need to be taken by the lactating mother. 
How can the pregnant and lactating women meet these nutritional demands? 
The pregnant/lactating woman should eat a wide variety of foods to make sure 
that her own nutritional needs as well as those of her growing foetus are met. There 
is no particular need to modify the usual dietary pattern. However, the quantity and 
frequency  of  usage  of  the  different  foods  should  be  increased.  She  can  derive 
maximum amount of energy (about 60%) from rice, wheat and millets. Cooking oil is 
a concentrated source of both energy and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Good quality 
protein  is  derived  from  milk,  fish,  meat,  poultry  and  eggs.  However,  a  proper 
combination of cereals, pulses and nuts also provides adequate proteins. Mineral 
and vitamin requirements are met by consuming a variety of seasonal vegetables 
particularly green leafy vegetables, milk and fresh fruits. Bioavailability of iron can be 
improved by using fermented and sprouted grams and foods rich in vitamin C such 
as citrus fruits. Milk is the best source of biologically available calcium. Though it is 
possible to meet the requirements for most of the nutrients through a balanced diet, 
pregnant/lactating women are advised to take daily supplements of iron, folic acid, 
vitamin B  and calcium (Annexure 3).  
What additional care is required ?

12

Adequate intake of a nutritious diet is reflected in optimal weight gain during 
pregnancy (10 kg) by the expectant woman. She should choose foods rich in fibre 
(around 25 g/1000 kcal) like whole grain cereals, pulses and vegetables, to avoid 
constipation. She should take plenty of  fluids including 8-12 glasses of water per 
day.  Salt  intake  should  not  be  restricted  even  to  prevent  pregnancy-induced 
hypertension and pre-eclampsia. Excess intake of beverages containing caffeine 
like coffee and tea adversely affect fetal growth and hence, should be avoided.
 
In  addition  to  satisfying  these  dietary  requisites,  a  pregnant  woman  should 
undergo periodic health check-up for weight gain, blood pressure, anaemia and 
receive tetanus toxoid immunization. She requires enough physical exercise with 
adequate rest for 2-3 hrs during the day. Pregnant and lactating women should not 
indiscriminately take any drugs without medical advice, as some of them could be 
harmful  to  the  fetus/baby.  Smoking  and  tobacco  chewing  and  consumption  of 
alcohol should be avoided. Wrong food beliefs and taboos should be discouraged.

The most important food safety problem is microbial food borne illness and its 
prevention during pregnancy is one of the important public health measure. Avoiding 
contaminated foods is important protective measure against food borne illness.

22

POINTS TO PONDER

vEat more food during pregnancy. 
vEat more whole grains, sprouted grams and fermented foods.
vTake milk/meat/eggs in adequate amounts.
vEat plenty of vegetables and fruits.
vAvoid superstitions and food taboos. 
vDo not use alcohol and tobacco. Take medicines only when prescribed. 
vTake iron, folate and calcium supplements regularly, after 14-16 weeks 

of  pregnancy and continue the same during lactation.

EAT FOLATE-RICH FOODS

?Folic acid is essential for the synthesis of haemoglobin. 
?Folic acid deficiency leads to macrocytic anaemia. 
?Pregnant women need more of folic acid.
?Folic  acid  supplements  increase  birth  weight  and  reduce  congenital 

anomalies.

?Green leafy vegetables, legumes, nuts and liver are good sources of folic 

acid.

?500 mg (0.5mg) folic acid supplementation is advised preconceptionally and 
through out pregnancy for women with history of congenital anomalies (neural 
tube defects, cleft palate).  

23

EAT IRON-RICH FOODS

?Iron  is  needed  for  hemoglobin  synthesis,  mental  function  and  to  provide 

immunity against diseases. 

?Deficiency of iron leads to anemia. 
?Iron  deficiency  is  common  particularly  in  women  of  reproductive  age  and 

children. 

?Iron deficiency during pregnancy increases maternal mortality and low birth 

weight infants.

?In children, it increases susceptibility to infection and impairs learning ability.
?Plant foods like green leafy vegetables, legumes and dry fruits contain iron.
?Iron is also obtained through meat, fish and poultry products. 
?Iron bio-availability is poor from plant foods but is good from animal foods. 
?Vitamin C - rich fruits like gooseberries (Amla), guava and citrus improve iron 

absorption from plant foods. 

?Beverages  like  tea  bind  dietary  iron  and  make  it  unavailable.  Hence,  they 

should be avoided before during or soon after a meal. 

?Commonly consumed plant based diets provide around 18mg of iron as against 
recommended intake of 35mg per day. Therefore, supplementation of iron 
(100 mg elemental iron, 0.5 mg folic acid) is recommended for 100 days during 
pregnancy from 16  week onwards to meet the demands of pregnancy.

th

24

Promote exclusive breastfeeding for six months and 

encourage breastfeeding till two years or more, 

Guideline 3

if possible

Rationale:

  Exclusive breast-feeding ensures safe nutrition to the infant 
and all round development of health

?Breast-milk is the most natural and perfect food for normal growth and healthy 

development of infants. 

?Colostrum is rich in nutrients and anti-infective factors and should be fed to 

infants.

?Breast-feeding reduces risk of infections.  
?It establishes mother-infant contact and promotes mother-child bonding. 
?It prolongs birth interval by fertility control (delayed return of menstruation). 
?Breast-feeding helps in retraction of the uterus. 
?Incidence of breast cancer is lower in mothers who breast feed their children. 
?Breast feeding is associated with better cognitive development of children and 

may provide some long-term health benefits.

Why breast-feed the infant?

Breast-milk contains all essential nutrients needed for the infant; it provides the 
best nutrition and protects the infant from infections. Breast-milk is a natural food 
and is more easily digested and absorbed by the infant as compared to formula milk 
prepared from other sources. Colostrum, which is the milk secreted during the first 3-
4 days after child birth, is rich in proteins, minerals, vitamins especially vitamin A and 
antibodies.  In  addition,  it  has  a  laxative  effect  as  well.  Breast-feeding  helps  in 
reducing fertility and facilitates spacing of children. Lactation provides emotional 
satisfaction to the mother and the infant. Recent evidence suggests that human milk 
may  confer  some  long  term  benefits  such  as  lower  risk  of  certain  autoimmune 
diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity and related disorders and probably 
some cancers. Therefore, breast milk is the best milk for the newborn and growing 
infant.
What are the advantages of breast-milk?

In addition to providing nutrients, breast-milk has several special components 
such as growth factors, enzymes, hormones and anti-infective factors. The amount 

25

of milk secreted increases gradually in the first few days after delivery, reaching the 
peak during the second month, at which level it is maintained until about 6 months of 
age. An average Indian woman secretes about 750 ml of milk per day during the first 
6 months and 600 ml/day subsequently up to one year. Many essential components 
are  in  concentrated  amounts  in  colostrum  as  compared  to  mature  milk, 
compensating for the low output during early lactation.

Breast-milk provides good quality proteins, fat, vitamins, calcium, iron and other 
minerals up to 4-6 months. In fact, quality of some of the nutrients can be improved 
by  supplementing  the  diet  of  the  mother  with  nutrients.  Growth  performance  of 
majority of the breast-fed infants is satisfactory up to 6 months of age.   Breast 
feeding is associated with better cognitive development possibly due to the high 
content  of  docosahexaeonic  acid  (DHA)  which  plays  an  important  role  in  brain 
development.
When to start breast feeding and how long to continue?
Mother-infant contact should be established as early 

as possible (immediately after birth) by permitting the 
infant to suck at the breast. Mothers can breast-feed 
from  as  early  as  30  minutes  after  delivery. 
Colostrum should be made available to the infant 
immediately after birth. Feeding honey, glucose, 
water or dilute milk formula before lactation should be 
avoided and the infant should be allowed to suck, which 
helps  in  establishing  lactation.  Colostrum  should  not  be 
discarded, as is sometimes practiced. 

Breast-feeding in India is common among the rural and urban poor, being less so 
among the urban middle and upper classes. The poorer groups continue breast-
feeding for longer duration than the educated upper and middle income groups. The 
economically advantaged or the working mother tends to discontinue breast-feeding 
early. A baby should be exclusively breast-fed only up to 6 months and comple-
mentary foods should be introduced thereafter. Breast-feeding can be continued as 
long as possible, even up to 2 years. Demand feeding helps in maintaining lactation 
for a longer time. If babies are quiet or sleep for 2 hours after a feed and show 
adequate weight gain, feeding may be assumed as adequate. Breast-fed infants do 
not  need  additional  water.  Feeding  water  reduces  the  breast  milk  intake  and 
increases the risk of diarrhoea and should, therefore, be avoided. Giving additional 
water is unnecessary even in hot climate.

26

What are the effects of maternal malnutrition on breast-milk?

Composition of breast-milk depends to some extent on maternal nutrition.   In 
general, even the undernourished mothers can successfully breast-feed. But in the 
case of severe malnutrition, both the quality and quantity of breast-milk may be 
affected.  Protein  content  of  breast-milk  appears  to  be  much  less  affected  as 
compared to fat in malnutrition. Concentration of water-soluble vitamins as well as 
fat soluble vitamin A (beta-carotene) is influenced by the quality of the maternal diet.  
Supplementation of vitamins A and B-complex to lactating mothers increases the 
levels of these vitamins in breast-milk. Zinc and iron from breast-milk are better 
absorbed than from other food sources. Trace element composition of breast-milk, 
however, is not affected by the mother's nutritional status. 
How does breast-milk protect against infection ?

Diseases and death among breast-fed infants are much lower than those among 
formula-fed infants. Breast-feeding protects against diarrhoea and upper respiratory 
tract infections. The bifidus factor in breast-milk promotes the natural gut flora. The 
gut flora and the low pH of breast-milk inhibit the growth of pathogens. Breast-milk 
has immunoglobulins (IgA), lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase and complements which 
protect the infant from several infections. Antibodies to E-coli and some viruses are 
found in breast milk, which protect the gut mucosa. Breast-feeding also protects 
infants from vulnerability to  allergic reactions. 
What ensures an adequate supply of breast-milk?

It is necessary that the woman is emotionally prepared during pregnancy for 
breast-feeding and is encouraged to eat a well-balanced diet. Anxiety and emotional 
upset must be avoided and adequate rest should be ensured. It is necessary to 
prepare the breast, particularly the nipple, for breast-feeding. Mother should initiate 
breast-feeding as early as possible after delivery and feed the child on demand. Milk 
production of the mother is determined by the infant’s demand. Frequent sucking by 
the baby and complete emptying of breast are important for sustaining adequate 
breast  milk  output. A  working  mother  can  express  her  breast  milk  and  store  it 
hygienically up to 8 hrs. This can be fed to her infant by the caretaker. 
Are drugs secreted in breast-milk ? 

Since, drugs (antibiotics, caffeine, hormones and alcohol) are secreted into the 
breast-milk  and  could  prove  harmful  to  the  breast-fed  infant,  caution  should  be 
exercised by the lactating mother while taking medicines.

Should HIV positive women breast feed their babies?

HIV may be transmitted from mother to infant through breast milk. However, 
women living in the resource poor settings in developing countries may not have 
access to safe, hygienic and affordable replacement feeding options. Considering 
the  important  role  of  breast  milk  in  child  growth  and  development,  following 
recommendations  have  been  proposed  by  National AIDS  Control  Organization 
(NACO).  When  replacement  feeding  is  not  acceptable,  feasible,  affordable, 
sustainable and safe (AFASS), exclusive breast-feeding is recommended during the 
first months of life. Every effort should be made to promote exclusive breast-feeding 
for up to four months in the case of HIV positive mothers followed by weaning, and 
complete stoppage of breast feeding at six months in order to restrict transmission 
through breast feeding. However, such mothers will be informed about the risk of 
transmission of HIV through breast milk and its consequences. In addition, based on 
the principle of informed choice, HIV infected women should be counseled about the 
risk of HIV transmission through breast milk and the risks and benefits of each 
feeding method, with specific guidance in selecting the option most likely to be 
suitable for their situation. In any case, mixed feeding i.e. breast-feeding along with 
other  feeds  should  be  strictly  discouraged  as  it  increases  the  risk  of  HIV 
transmission.

POINTS TO PONDER
?Start breast-feeding within an hour after delivery and do not discard 

colostrum. 

?Breast-feed exclusively (not even water) for a minimum of six months 

if the growth of the infant is adequate.  

?Continue breast-feeding in addition to nutrient-rich complementary 

foods (weaning foods), preferably up to 2 years.  

?Breast-feed  the  infant  frequently  and  on  demand  to  establish  and 

maintain good milk supply. 

?Take a nutritionally adequate diet both during pregnancy and lactation. 
?Avoid  tobacco  (smoking  and  chewing),  alcohol  and  drugs  during 

lactation. 

?Ensure active family support for breast-feeding.

Feed home based semi-solid foods to the infant after 

Guideline 4 

six months

Rationale: 

Easy  to  cook  home  made  preparations  are  hygenic  and 
healthy foods for the growing baby

EBreast-milk alone is not adequate for the infant beyond 6 months of age. 
EIntroduction of food supplements (semi-solid complementary foods) along 

with breast-feeding is necessary for infants after 6 months of age. 

EProvision  of  adequate  and  appropriate  supplements  to  young  children 

prevents malnutrition. 

EHygienic  practices  should  be  observed  while  preparing  and  feeding  the 

complementary food to the child; otherwise, it will lead to diarrhoea.

It is well accepted that breast milk is the best food for an infant. Fortunately, in 
India, most rural mothers are able to breast-feed their children for prolonged periods.  
In fact, this is a boon to Indian children as otherwise the prevalence of under-nutrition 
among them would have been much higher. However, often, children are solely 
breast-fed even beyond the age of one year in the belief that breast-milk alone is 
adequate for the child until he/she is able to pick up food and eat. This practice 
results in under-nutrition among young children. Working mothers, on the other 
hand are unable to breast-feed their children for longer periods, as they go to work 
outside.  
What are supplementary/complementary foods?

Foods that are regularly fed to the infant, in addition to breast-milk, providing 
sufficient nutrients are known as supplementary or complementary foods. These 
could be liquids like milk or semi-solids like 'kheer' in the case of infants or solid 
preparations like rice etc., in the case of children over the age of one year. 
Why use complementary foods and when? 

At birth, mother's milk alone is adequate for the infant. Requirements of all the 
nutrients progressively increase with the infant's growth. Simultaneously, the breast-
milk secretion in the mother comes down with time. Thus, infants are deprived of 
adequate nutrients due to the dual factors of increased nutrient requirements and 
decreased  availability  of  breast-milk.  Usually,  these  changes  occur  at  about  6 
months of age. Hence, promotion of optimal growth in infants, calls for introduction of 
adequate food supplements in addition to continued breast feeding, from  the age of 
6 months onwards. 

29

Can home-made recipes be nutritious supplements?

Low-cost food supplements can be prepared at home from commonly used 
ingredients such as cereals (wheat, rice, ragi, jowar, bajra, etc.); pulses (grams/ 
dhals), nuts and oilseeds (groundnut, sesame, etc.), oils (groundnut oil, sesame oil 
etc.) and sugar and jaggery. Such supplements are easily digested by all infants, 
including those with severe malnutrition. The impression that only the commercially 
available supplementary foods are nutritious is not correct. Some examples of low 
cost complementary foods are given on page 33.  
What are the principles in preparing complementary food supplements?

Weaning foods based on cereal-pulse-nut and sugar/ jaggery combinations will 
provide  good  quality  protein,  adequate  calories  and  other  protective  nutrients.   
Since infants cannot consume bulky complementary food, in sufficient quantities, 
energy-rich foods like fats and sugars should be included in such preparations. 
Infants  can  also  be  fed  green  leafy  vegetables  (GLVs),  which  are  rich,  yet 
inexpensive, sources of vitamins and minerals. However, greens should be well 
cleaned before cooking lest the infants develop loose motions. Dietary fibre in green 
leafy  vegetables  can,  by  itself,  promote  the  bowel  movements  leading  to  loose 
motions in infants. Since GLVs are rich in dietary fibre, it is advisable to initially feed 
only the juice of the GLVs after cooking them properly. Infants should be introduced 
to different vegetables and fruits gradually. It should, however, be remembered that 
these dietary articles should be thoroughly cooked and mashed before feeding. In 
families which can afford egg yolk and meat soup can be introduced.  At about one 
year of age, the child should share the family diet. 
Amylase-Rich Foods (ARFs)

Flours of germinated cereals, which are rich 
in the enzyme alpha-amylase, constitute ARFs. 
Even small amounts of this type of foods liquefy 
and reduce the bulk of the cereal-based diet.   
Thus,  ARFs  help  in  increasing  the  energy 
density of weaning gruels and in reducing its 
bulk as well. 

Mothers can add ARF to increase the 
digestibility of the low-cost weaning foods 
prepared at home. Preparation of ARF is 
very simple and can be done by mothers 
at home.

30

PREPARATION OF AMYLASE RICH FOOD (ARF)

Take 250 g of wheat  

Add 2-3 volumes of water soak it for 8 hrs

Drain excess water  

Germinate wheat in dark for 24-48 hours

Sun dry for 5-8 hours

Roast gently in flat pan just to remove water

Grind and powder the grains (ARF)

Store in airtight bottles/jars

 Add 5 g (one tea spoon) of ARF, after cooking, to every feed 

How to feed a young infant?

Infants cannot eat large quantities of food in one sitting at a given time. So, they 
should be fed small quantities at frequent intervals (3-4 times a day). Also, the food 
should be of semi-solid consistency for easy swallowing. When such semi-solid 
foods are offered initially, the infant tends to spit it out. This should not be mistaken as 
dislike for that food. The fact is that the young infant cannot achieve full coordination 
needed for the act of swallowing and hence, brings out the food by movements of its 
tongue. Physiological maturity of swallowing the semi-solid food develops when the 
food is regularly given every day. 
What are the hygienic practices to be adopted? 

It is important to ensure that hygienic practices are scrupulously followed. All the 
dietary ingredients should be thoroughly cleaned. Vegetables should be washed 
well  to  remove  contaminants/  parasites/  pesticides  before  cutting.  Vegetables 
should  preferably  be  steam-cooked  to  reduce  cooking  losses.  At  the  time  of 
preparation and feeding of the recipes, mother should observe proper personal 
hygiene and the utensils used for cooking should be thoroughly washed or sterilized, 

31

wherever possible. A number of pre-cooked and ready-to-eat foods can be prepared 
for use as complementary foods (Refer page 33). Such foods should be stored in 
clean bottles or tins. As feeding is likely to be time consuming, the cup or the plate 
from which the recipe is being fed to the infant should be kept covered to protect it 
from  flies.  Most  often,  diarrhea  is  caused  by  unhygienic  practices  adopted  by 
mothers. The weaning foods which are properly cleaned and well-cooked are safe 
even for young infants.
POINTS TO PONDER

?Breast-milk alone is not enough for infants after 6 months of age. 
?Complementary foods should be given after 6 months of age, in addition 

to breast-feeding. 

?Do not delay complementary feeding. 
?Feed low-cost home-made complementary foods.
?Feed complementary food on demand 3-4 times a day. 
?Provide fruits and well cooked vegetables.
?Observe  hygienic  practices  while  preparing  and  feeding  the 

complementary food. 

?Read nutrition label on baby foods carefully.

WHAT SHOULD BE DONE IF BREAST-MILK IS NOT ADEQUATE?

?If breast-feeding fails, the infant needs to be fed animal milk or commercial 

infant formula.

?Milk should be boiled before being fed to the baby.
?To start with, milk may be diluted with an equal volume of water.
?Full strength milk may be started from 4 weeks of age.
?Infants fed animal milk should receive supplements of iron and vitamin C.
?About 120-180 ml of milk should be fed with one teaspoon of sugar per feed, 

6-8 times over the day.

?While reconstituting the infant formula, the instructions given on the label 

should be strictly followed.

?The feeds should be prepared and given using a sterile cup, spoon, bottles 

and nipples taking utmost care.

?Overfeeding should be avoided in artificially-fed infants to prevent obesity.
?Low-cost home-made complementary foods should be preferred.

Guideline 5 

Ensure adequate and appropriate diets for children 

and adolescents both in health and sickness

Rationale:

Well-formulated  balanced  diets  for  children  and 
adolescents help optimum growth and boosts their immunity

}

A nutritionally adequate and balanced diet is essential for optimal growth and 
development.

}Appropriate diet and physical activity during childhood is essential for optimum 
body composition, BMI and to reduce the risk of diet-related chronic diseases 
in later life and prevent vitamin deficiency. 

}Common infections and malnutrition contribute significantly to child morbidity 

and mortality. 

}A child needs to eat more during and after episodes of infections to maintain 

good nutritional status. 

Why do children and adolescents require more food?

Childhood and adolescence are periods of continuous growth and development. 
An infant grows rapidly, doubling its birth weight by 5 months and tripling it by 1 year 
of age. During the second year, the child increases not only in height by 7-8 cm but 
also gains 4 times of its birth weight. During the pre-adolescent period the child 
grows, on an average, 6-7 cm in height and 1.5 to 3 kg in weight every year and 
simultaneously development and maturation of various tissues and organs take 
place (Table 5). 

Adolescent period (teenage) is spread almost over 
a decade. It is characterized by rapid increase in height 
and weight, hormonal changes, sexual maturation and 
wide swings in emotion. Adolescent growth spurt starts 
at about 10-12 years in girls and two years later in boys. 
The annual peak rates for height and weight are 9-10 
cm and 8-10 kg. Development of critical bone mass is 
essential during this period as this forms the ground for 
maintaining mineral integrity of the bone in later life. 
The pattern and proportion of various body components like body water, muscle 
mass, bone and fat increase during the entire childhood and adolescence to reach 
adult values by about 18 years. Adolescent girls are at greater physiological stress 
than  boys  because  of  menstruation.  Their  nutritional  needs  are  of  particular 
importance  as  they  have  to  prepare  for  motherhood.  All  these  rapid  anabolic 
changes require more nutrients per unit body weight.

34

Growing children and adolescents require more calcium. Though recommended 
dietary allowances for calcium are about 600-800 mg/day, it is desirable to give 
higher quantities of calcium for adolescents to achieve high peak bone mass. To 
achieve optimal peak bone mass, it is recommended to consume calcium rich foods 
like milk and milk products, fox tail millet (Ragi), til etc.

Young children below the age of 5 years should be given less bulky foods, rich in 
energy and protein such as legumes, pulses, nuts, edible oil/ghee, sugar, milk and 
eggs. Vegetables including green leafy vegetables and locally available seasonal 
fruits should be part of their daily menu. Snacks make a useful contribution to the 
nutrient  requirements,  particularly  in  older  children  and  adolescents.  Frequent 
changes in the menu are often liked by children.  

Older children and adolescents should consume plenty of milk to fulfill the high 
calcium  requirements.  Cooking  oils/ghee  (25-50g)  should  be  consumed.  Over-
indulgence  in  fats  may  be  avoided.  Excessive  salt  intake  should  be  avoided 
particularly by children having a family history of hypertension. Adolescence is the 
vulnerable  stage  for  developing  wrong  food  habits  as  well  as  bad  habits  like 
smoking, chewing tobacco or drinking alcohol. These should be avoided. In addition 
to consumption of a nutritious well balanced diet, appropriate lifestyle practices and 
involvement in physical activity such as games/sports should be encouraged among 
children and adolescents. Balanced diet for children and adolescents are given in 
annexure 4 and adolescent growth standards are given in annexure 5.
How do infections in children lead to malnutrition? 

Common childhood infections like diarrhea, measles and pneumonia occur in 
association with malnutrition and contribute to about 70% of mortality. Appropriate 
feeding  during  infection  is  essential,  which  demands  a  lot  of  patience  from  the 
mother.

During periods of infection, children tend to eat less due to reduced appetite.   
Many children vomit frequently. Nutrients are also lost in urine and faeces. The 
unhealthy practice of restricting diet, including breast-feeding, by the mother during 
any sickness could further aggravate the problem.  Hence, extra care is needed in 
feeding  the  child  appropriately  during  and  after  illness  to  prevent  subsequent 
nutritional deficiencies. 
How should a child be fed during illness? 

Breast-feeds are often well accepted and tolerated even by sick children and 
should be continued except in severe gastroenteritis associated with shock. For 
older children, consuming an adult diet, soft cooked food may be offered at frequent 
intervals. The quantity of the feeds may be increased, after the illness has subsided, 
till the original weight is regained.

35

What should be done during diarrhea?

Diarrhea  is  a  common  childhood  disease  which  leads  to  dehydration  and 
sometimes death. The child requires prompt correction of fluid and electrolyte loss 
using oral rehydration solution (ORS) along with appropriate/adequate feeding. 

ORS can be prepared by adding a pinch of salt (between thumb and index finger) 
and a teaspoon of sugar to a glass of potable water. Home-made fluids such as rice 
kanji or buttermilk with salt can also be used. During infections, children should 
frequently be given small quantities of fluids by mouth, including plain water.  During 
diarrhea,  feeding  should  be  continued,  though  this  goes  against  the  popular 
practice. Breast-milk promotes sodium and water transport across the gut and, thus, 
prevents dehydration and weight loss, in addition to providing other nutrients.  

The diet of 1-2 year old children with diarrhea should provide energy of about 
1000 Kcal/day. Calorie-rich, semi-solid, soft diets may be prepared from a variety of 
cereals and pulses. Sprouted grains are easily digestible and provide good nutrition. 
Fat and sugar help in reducing the bulk of the diets and make them energy dense. 
Milk may be mixed with cereal diet to avoid lactose malabsorption. If milk is not 
tolerated, it may be replaced by an equal volume of curd/yogurt/soymilk. Mashed 
vegetables  may  be  incorporated  in  the  diet.  Feeding  becomes  easier  after  the 
infection subsides. About 6-8 feeds should be given during the day so that the extra 
food (120-140 Kcal/kg) may be consumed by the child without any difficulty. 
How important is the problem of lactose intolerance? 

Deficiency of the enzyme lactase leads to lactose intolerance. During acute or 
chronic diarrhea, lactose intolerance is a mild and transient problem. This problem 
can be overcome by reducing the quantity of milk taken at a time or taking milk along 
with a cereal-pulse meal. There is no need to stop milk in acute diarrhoea. In chronic 
diarrhea, some children may develop lactose intolerance. In such children, milk may 
be stopped temporarily. A diet based on cereals and pulses or chicken and egg white 
allows the gut to recover and milk can then be slowly introduced. Adequate feeding 
during and after diarrhea prevents malnutrition.

POINTS TO PONDER

}

Take extra care in feeding a young child and include soft cooked 
vegetables and seasonal fruits. 

}Give plenty of milk and milk products to children and adolescents.
}Promote physical activity and appropriate lifestyle practices 
}Discourage overeating as well as indiscriminate dieting.

EAT CALCIUM-RICH FOODS

ECalcium is needed for growth and bone development. 
EChildren require more calcium. 
ECalcium prevents osteoporosis (thinning of bones).
EMilk, curds and nuts are rich sources of bio-available calcium (Ragi 

and GLV are also good dietary sources of calcium).
ERegular exercise reduces calcium loss from bones. 
EExposure to sunlight maintains vitamin D status which helps in 

calcium absorption. 

DURING  ILLNESS

]Never starve the child. 
]Feed energy-rich cereals-pulse diet with milk and mashed vegetables.
]Feed small quantities at frequent intervals. 
]Continue breast-feeding as long as possible.
]Give plenty of fluids during illness. 
]Use oral rehydration solution to prevent and correct dehydration during 

diarrhea episodes.

Guideline 6

Eat plenty of vegetables and fruits

Rationale: 

Green leafy vegetables, other vegetables and fresh fruits are 
treasure trove of several minerals and vitamins and hence, 
protect from diseases

¡Normal diet, to be wholesome and tasty, should include fresh vegetables 

and fruits, which are store houses of micronutrients 
¡Vegetables/fruits are rich sources of micronutrients.
¡Fruits and vegetables also provide phytonutrients and fibre which are of 

vital health significance

¡They help in prevention of micronutrient malnutrition and certain chronic 

diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cataract and cancer.  

¡Fresh fruits are nutritionally superior to fruit juices.

Why should we eat vegetables/fruits?

Fresh  Vegetables  and 

fruits  are  rich  sources  of  micronutrients  and 
macronutrients (Annexure 15). The micronutrients present are minerals (like iron 
and  calcium)  and  vitamins  (like  vitamin  C,  folic  acid,  B  complex  vitamins  and 
carotenoids)  whereas,  the  macronutrients  present  are  complex  carbohydrates/ 
fibre.  They  contain  abundant  amounts  of  iron,  calcium,  vitamin  C,  folic  acid, 
carotenoids (precursors of vitamin A) and phytochemicals. Some vegetables and 
fruits provide very low calories (Annexure 6), whereas some others such as potato, 
sweet potato, tapioca and yam as well as fruits like banana are rich in starch which 
provides energy in good amount. Therefore, vegetables and fruits can be used to 
increase or decrease calories in our diet.
What functions do these nutrients and special factors in vegetables/fruits
perform in our body?
Iron

Iron is an essential element necessary for the formation of haemoglobin, the red 
pigment present in the red cells of blood. Haemoglobin plays an important role in the 
transport of oxygen to the tissues. Reduction in haemoglobin in blood leads to 
anaemia, a condition characterised by paleness and easy fatigue and increased 
susceptibility to infections. Iron is available in plenty in green leafy vegetables. But 
the absorption of iron is limited. Vitamin C rich foods must be consumed daily to 
improve iron absorption. 

40

Vitamin A

This  fat-soluble  vitamin  is  necessary  for  clear  vision  in  dim  light,  and  for 
maintaining the integrity of epithelial tissues. In vitamin A deficiency, the white of the 
eye (conjunctiva) loses its luster and becomes dry. In severe vitamin A deficiency, 
the black area of the eye (cornea) gets necrosed, leading to irreversible blindness in 
young children. Vitamin A also has a role in maintaining resistance of the body to 
common infections. Carotenoids are plentiful in fruits and vegetables that are green 
or deep yellow/orange in colour, such as green leafy vegetables, carrots, tomatoes, 
sweet potatoes, papaya, mango etc.
Vitamin C

Vitamin C is an essential nutrient required for healthy bones and teeth. It also 
promotes  iron  absorption.  Vitamin  C  deficiency  is  characterised  by  weakness,   
bleeding gums and defective bone growth. Vitamin C is abundantly available in 
fresh amla, citrus fruits, guava, banana and certain vegetables such as tomatoes. 
However, it is very susceptible to destruction by atmospheric oxidation. It is for this 
reason that when vegetables become dry and stale or cut and exposed to air most of 
the vitamin C originally present in destroyed.
Folic acid

Folic acid is a haemopoietic vitamin essential for multiplication and maturation of 
red cells in our body. Its deficiency leads to megaloblastic anaemias. Folic acid 
intake  during  pregnancy  protects  the  foetus  from  developing  certain  congenital 
defects. It also promotes the birth weight of infants. Folic acid deficiency increases 
homocysteine levels in blood, thereby increasing the risk for heart disease. Green 
leafy vegetables, legumes, nuts and liver are good sources of folates. 
Calories

Many of the vegetables and fruits have low calories (Annexure 6). Large intake 
of low calorie vegetables and fruits can help in reducing calories in diet and help in 
obesity management. On the other hand vegetables like colocasia, potato, tapioca, 
yam, sweet potato and fruits like banana, avocado pear (215 Kcal) and mahua (111 
Kcal) have more than 100 kcal per 100gram (Annexure 7). 
Phytonutrients 

Vegetables provide phytochemicals and considerable health significance to the 
human  body.  Among  these,  dietary  fibre,  antioxidants  and  other  bio-active 
constituents require special mention. These special factors are required for delaying 

41

ageing and preventing the processes which lead to diseases such as cataract, 
cardio-vascular diseases, diabetes and cancer. 
Dietary Fibre

Dietary fibre delays the intestinal transit of the food consumed. Dietary fibre is 
important  for  proper  bowel  function,  to  reduce  chronic  constipation,  diverticular 
disease, haemorrhoids coronary heart diseases, diabetes and obesity. They also 
reduce plasma cholesterol. The protective role of dietary fibre against colon cancer 
has long been recognised. 
Antioxidants

In the recent past, the role of vegetables and fruits as sources of antioxidants 
has been receiving considerable attention. Antioxidants restrict the damage that 
reactive oxygen free radicals can cause to the cell and cellular components. They 
are of primary biological value in giving protection from certain diseases. Some of 
the  diseases  that  have  their  origin  in  deleterious  free  radical  reactions  are 
atherosclerosis, cancer, inflammatory joint diseases, asthma, diabetes etc. Raw 
and fresh vegetables like green leafy vegetables, carrots, fresh fruits including citrus 
and tomatoes have been identified as good sources of antioxidants (free radical-
scavengers). The nutrients vitamin C and carotenoids that are present in these 
vegetables  are  also  potential  antioxidants.  Different  colored  vegetable  provide 
different  antioxidants  like  orange  colored  provide  beta-carotene,  red  provide 
lycopene, deep red provide betalines, blue and purple provide anthocynins.
How much should we consume? 

The  Expert  Committee  of  the  Indian  Council  of 

Medical  Research,  taking  into  consideration  the 
nutrient requirements, has recommended 
that every individual should consume 
at least 300 g of vegetables (GLV : 50 
g; Other vegetables : 200 g; Roots & 
Tubers  :  50  g)  in  a  day.  In  addition, 
fresh fruits (100 g), should be consumed 
regularly.  Since  requirements  of  iron  and 
folic acid are higher for pregnant women 
they  should  consume  100g  of  leafy 
vegetables daily. High calorie vegetables 
and fruits to be restricted for over weight/ 
obese subjects.

42

Which vegetables and fruits should be consumed?

We should consume fresh, locally available and preferably seasonal vegetables 
and fruits. They have more micronutrients and are tasty. However, no single fruit or 
vegetable provides all the nutrients you need. The key lies in eating a variety of them 
and with different colors. Include commonly consumed leafy greens, tomatoes and 
other vegetables, apart from those which are yellow, orange, red, deep red, purple 
colored citrus fruits, being vitamin C-rich enrich the diets significantly. Along with 
these, try selecting some new vegetables and fruits to your meals.
How to prevent cooking losses ?

Vitamins are lost during washing of cut vegetables and cooking of foodstuffs. 
However,  proper  methods  of  cooking  can  substantially  reduce  these  losses. 
Nutrient loss is high when the vegetables are washed after cutting or when they are 
cut into small pieces for cooking. Consumption of properly washed raw and fresh 
vegetables is always beneficial. 
How do we get these foods?

Green leafy vegetables (GLVs), other vegetables and fruits are easily available. 
Most vegetables, particularly GLVs are inexpensive. In fact, these foods can be 
grown in the backyard with very little effort and cost. Even in lean seasons like 
summer, they can be grown using water and waste from kitchen.
How to accommodate more servings of vegetables and fruits in a day?

To  get  the  maximum  nutritional  benefits  from  fruits  and  vegetables,  it  is 

important to find ways to eat more servings of vegetables and fruits per day. 

43

POINTS TO PONDER

Include green leafy vegetables in daily diet. 

¡
¡Eat as much of other vegetables as possible daily. 
¡Eat  vegetables/  fruits  in  all  your  meals  in  various  forms  (curry, 

soups, mixed with curd, added to pulse preparations and rice).

¡Consume raw and fresh vegetables as salads.
¡Grow  the  family's  requirements  of  vegetables  in  the  kitchen  garden 

if possible.

¡Green  leafy  vegetables,  when  properly  cleaned  and  cooked  are

safe even for infants. 

¡Let  different  varieties  of  vegetables  and  fruits  add  color  to  your 

plate and vitality to your life.

¡Beta-carotene  rich  foods  like  dark  green,  yellow  and  orange 
colored  vegetables  and  fruits  (GLVs,  carrots,  papaya  and  mangoes) 
protect from vitamin A deficiency.

Guideline 7

Ensure moderate use of edible oils and animal foods 

and very less use of ghee/ butter/ vanaspati

Rationale: 

 leads to the 
Excessive use of plant and animal based fats
elevation  of  blood  lipids  thereby  increasing  the  risk  of 
heart disease and other illnesses. 

éFats/oils have high energy value and induce satiety.
éFats provide energy, essential fatty acids and promote absorption of fat-soluble 

vitamins.

éFats are precursors of biologically-active compounds in the body.
éDiets that provide excess of calories, fats and cholesterol elevate blood lipids 

(cholesterol and triglycerides) and promote blood clotting.

éExcessive fat in the diet increases the risk of obesity, heart disease, stroke and 

cancer.

éIll effects of excess dietary fats are initiated early in life.

Why do we need fats?

Cooking  oils  (liquid)  and  solid  fats  together  are  referred  to  as  fats.  Fats 
contribute to texture, flavor and taste and increase the palatability of the diet. Fats 
are essential for meeting some of the nutritional needs like essential fatty acids 
(linoleic n-6 and alpha-linolenic n-3) and serve as rich sources of energy. Therefore, 
fats should be consumed, in moderation. However, for the growth of young children 
high-calorific diets are required. This is achieved by inclusion of adequate amounts 
of fat (1g fat = 9 Kcals) in their diets as they cannot consume large quantities of bulky 
cereal - pulse- based diets.

Fats also promote the absorption of the four fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E and K), 

impart a feeling of fullness and satisfaction and thus, delay the onset of hunger.

Along with proteins, fats constitute major components of body fluids and cell 
membranes. The two essential fatty acids (EFA) namely, linoleic (LA n-6) and alpha-
linolenic  (ALA  n-3)  acids  (important  dietary  polyunsaturated  fatty  acids)  are 
metabolized at various sites in the body to generate a group of biologically-active 
compounds, which perform several important physiological functions. 
What are the sources of fat?

Dietary fats can be derived from plant and animal sources. Fats that are used 
as such at the table or during cooking (vegetable oils, vanaspati, butter and ghee) 

45

are termed as “visible” fats. Fats that are present as an integral components of 
various foods are referred to as “invisible” fat. Fats, in processed and ready to eat 
foods are known as hidden fats. Cereals contain only 2-3% of invisible fat. However, 
their contribution to overall fat intake is significant as they contribute to bulk of our 
Indian diets. The small amounts of invisible fat present in various foods add up to a 
substantial level in our daily diet (about 15 g in rural population and 30g among urban 
middle-income and high-income groups). Most animal foods provide high amounts 
of invisible fat.

How much visible fat do we need?

The total fat (visible + invisible) in the diet should provide between 20-30% of total 
calories. The visible fat intake in the diets can go upto 50g/person/day based on the 
level  of  physical  activity  and  physiological  status. Adults  with  sedentary  lifestyle 
should consume about 25 g of visible fat, while individuals involved in hard physical 
work require 30 - 40g of visible fat. Visible fat intake should be increased during 
pregnancy  and  lactation  to  30g.  The  higher  fat  and  EFA  requirements  during 
pregnancy and lactation are to meet the requirements of fetus and young infants, in 
view of their crucial role in physical and neuronal growth and development. Diets of 
young  children  and  adolescents  should  contain  about  30-50g/day.  However, 
ingestion of too much fat is not conducive to good health.
What are the chemical components of fat?
Fatty acids: All fats in foods provide mixtures of three types of fatty acids, which are 
the “building blocks” of fats. Fatty acids are the primary constituents of all dietary 
fats.  Based  on  their  chemical  nature,  the  fatty  acids  are  broadly  grouped  as 
saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA). There are 
several fatty acids in each group. Fats from coconut oil, vanaspati, animal fats (ghee 
and butter) and animal foods like milk, milk products and meat provide saturated 
fatty acids. The short and medium chain saturated fatty acids present in ghee, butter 

46

and coconut oil are easily digested and absorbed and are therefore, good for infants 
and  young  children.  However,  high  intake  of  saturated  fatty  acids  increases 
atherogenic risk and their intake should be limited in adults. Oils from sources such 
as palm, groundnut, cottonseed, sesame and olive are rich in monounsaturated 
fattyacids as compared to other oils. Linoleic (n-6) and  -linolenic (n-3) acids are the 
simple PUFA, which are present only in plant foods (Table 6). All vegetable oils 
(except coconut) are good sources of linoleic(n-6) acid. Soyabean, rapeseed and 
mustard oils are the only vegetable oils, which contribute significant proportion of a-
linolenic (n-3) acid. Legumes/pulses mustard and fenugreek seeds and green leafy 
vegetables are also good sources of a-linolenic (n-3) acid (Table 7). On the other 
hand, fish and fish oils provide long chain n-3 fatty acids, which are biologically more 
active than alpha-linolenic (n-3) acid present in plant foods.

Dietary  fats  also  contain  minor  components  such  as  tocopherols,  tocotrienols, 
sterols etc. The natural flavour of fats/oils is largely due to these minor components.  
Since most of the  minor components are antioxidants, they prevent fats from going 
rancid. Tocotrienols in palm oil, lignans in sesame oil and oryzanol and tocotrienols 
in rice-bran oil reduce blood cholesterol. Refining of oils, though does not alter their 
fatty acid composition, modifies the composition of minor components; for example, 
carotenes are lost during refining of crude palm oil.
Cholesterol: Cholesterol is present only in foods of animal origin such as milk, 
meat,  shrimp  and  prawn,  but  not  in  plant  foods.  Vegetable  oils  do  not  contain 
cholesterol. Egg yolk, and organ meats such as liver, kidney and brain contain very 
high amounts of cholesterol. Cholesterol is found in all body cells and plays a key 
role in the formation of brain, nerve tissue and is a pre-cursor for some hormones 
and vitamin D. It is synthesized in the body and hence it is not an essential dietary 
component.

Higher dietary cholesterol increases blood cholesterol. The blood cholesterol-
elevating effect of dietary saturated fats increases, when cholesterol consumption is 
high. Therefore, cholesterol intake should be maintained below 200 mg/day. One 
can reduce both saturated fat and cholesterol intake by limiting the consumption of 
high-fat animal foods like butter, ghee, meat, egg and organ meats and consuming 
low fat (skimmed) milk instead of whole milk. However, consumption of eggs (3eggs/ 
week) is recommended in view of several nutritional advantages.
What are the physiological/health implications of different fats/fatty acids?

Saturated fatty acids are known to increase serum total and LDL-cholesterol   
levels, reduce insulin sensitivity and enhance thrombogenicity and increase CVD 
risk. Therefore, SFA intake should not exceed 8-10% of total energy. Skimmed milk 
should  be  preferred  instead  of  whole  milk.  Restrict  consumption  of  butter  and 
cheese. PUFAs are essential components of cell membranes. While n-6 PUFAs are 
predominant in all cells, the nerve tissue has high levels of long chain n-3 PUFA. An 
alpha
appropriate balance of the these two classes of PUFAs, namely, linoleic and 
-
linolenic  acids  in  the  diets  is  essential  for  the  functioning  of  vascular,  immune, 
nervous and renal systems and for early human development. PUFAs particularly n-
3  PUFA  increase  insulin  sensitivity,  increase  peripheral  glucose  utilization  and 
decrease adiposity and hence are anti-atherogenic. n-6 PUFA decrease plasma 

48

cholesterol as well as HDL cholesterol level (only at high intake). The lipid lowering 
and other physiological effects of individual  members  of  the  PUFAs  vary  widely.   
As compared   to   linoleic   acid, alpha-linolenic (n-3) acid is more beneficial for 
prevention  of  inflammation  and  accumulation  of  fatty  material  in  blood  vessels 
(altheroscleros) and clotting of blood (thrombosis). The long chain n-3 PUFA of fish 
oils  and  micro  algae  have  greater  antiatherogenic,  antithrombotic  and  anti-
inflammatory  effects  than  alpha-linolenic  (n-3)  acid  of  plant  foods.  They  are 
important for vision and brain growth. Therefore, pregnant women should consume 
foods that are rich in ALA and long chain n-3 PUFA from fish and fish oils.

The intake of PUFA should be 8-10% of energy intake. The remaining 8-10% of 
fat calories can be derived from mono-unsaturated fatty acids, which also help in 
maintaining plasma cholesterol. Excessive use of highly unsaturated fats should be 
avoided.  Further,  to  get  a  good  proportion  of  all  the  classes  of  fatty  acids,  it  is 
advisable to consume more than one type of vegetable oils.

Fats/  lipids  (triglycerides,  cholesterol  and  phospholipids)  are  transported  in 
blood in combination with proteins in the form of   ‘lipoproteins’. The low density 
lipoproteins (LDL) transport cholesterol from liver to various tissues. High blood 
levels of LDL cholesterol ('bad' cholesterol) result in accumulation of lipids in the 
cells  (atherogenic  effect).  High  density  lipoproteins  (HDL)  ('good'  cholesterol) 
transport excess cholesterol from the tissues to the liver for degradation, and are 
therefore, anti-atherogenic. 
Choice of cooking oils

In  view  of  the  above,  an  ideal  quality  fat  for  good  health  is  the  one  which 
maintains a balance, so as to give a   ratio  of  polyunsaturated/ saturated (PUFA/ 
SFA)  of  0.8-1.0,  and  linoleic/  a-linolenic  (n-6/  n-3)  of  5-10  in  the  total  diet.  For 
ensuring this appropriate balance of fatty acids in cereal-based diets, it is necessary 
to increase the a-linolenic (n-3) acid intake and reduce  the quantity of linoleic (n-6) 
acid obtained from the cooking oil. Hence, the choice of cooking oil should be as 
follows:

Groundnut or Sesame or Rice bran
Groundnut or Sesame or Rice bran
Groundnut or Sesame or Rice bran
Palmolein + Soyabean
Safflower or Sunflower + Palmolein + Mustard

+ Mustard
+ Canola
+ Soyabean

Use of more than one source of fat/oil has the added advantage of providing a 
variety of minor components in the diet. An additional way of increasing alpha-
linolenic (n-3) acid intake is to ensure regular consumption of oils and foods rich in 

49

6 & 

-linolenic (n-3) acid (Table 

7). Non-vegetarians have an advantage of 
alpha
eating fish, which provides preformed long chain n-3 PUFA. Ideally, part of visible fat 
and/or invisible fat from animal foods may be substituted by whole nuts and legumes 
with good proportion of  -linolenic (n-3) acid, which are also good sources of protein, 
fiber, vitamins and minerals (ALA  content of foods is given in annexure 9). 

The plant oils in addition contain certain useful substances such as lignans 
(sesame oil), sterols, tocopherols (vitamin E) oryzanole (rice bran oil), carotenoids - 
all  of  which  reduce  cholesterol  and  reduce  oxidant  damage  due  to  ageing, 
inflamation which occur in chronic diseases. 
What about vanaspati ? 

Vanaspati  is  prepared  by  hydrogenation  of  vegetable  oils.  During  hydroge-
nation, the liquid oils become solid because the mono and polyunsaturated fatty 
acids are converted into saturated fatty acids and isomers called trans fatty acids. 
Vanaspati is used as a substitute for ghee in cooking and the preparation of bakery 
products, sweets and snack foods. Since, saturated fats are resistant to oxidation, 
foods  prepared  in  vanaspati  keep  fresh  for  a  longer  period.  Current  evidence 
indicates that saturated fatty acids and a high intake of trans fatty acids may increase 
the risk of heart disease. Therefore, it is essential to limit the intake of vanaspati.   
The intake of trans fatty acids should not exceed 1% of energy intake.  

50

POINTS TO PONDER

?Take just enough fat.
?Substitute part of visible fat and invisible fat from animal foods with 

whole nuts.

?Moderate  the  use  of  animal  foods  containing  high  fat,  SFA  and 

cholesterol.

?Limit the use of ghee, butter, especially vanaspati  as a cooking oil.
?Choose low- fat dairy foods in place of regular whole fat dairy foods.
?Eat foods rich in alpha-linolenic (ALA) acid such as legumes, green 

leafy vegetables, fenugreek and mustard seeds.

?Eat fish more frequently (at least 100-200g /week), prefer it to meat,   

poultry and limit/ avoid organ meats such as liver, kidney, brain etc.

?Egg has several important nutrients but is high in cholesterol. Limit 
the  consumption  to  3  eggs/  week.  However,  egg  white  may  be 
consumed in good amounts.

?Minimize consumption of ready- to- eat fast foods, bakery foods and 

processed foods prepared in hydrogenated fat.
?Use of re-heated fats and oils should be avoided.
?Use fats and oils in moderation and consume varieties of foods to get 

good proportion of all fatty acids for optimal health benefits.

age groups has occurred in last 2-3 decades.

¾About 30-50% of adult Indians are either overweight or obese.
¾Overweight and obese individuals are at an enhanced risk of co-morbidities 
including type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, gallstones, high blood cholesterol 
and  triglycerides,  orthopedic  disorders  (Osteoarthritis),  hypertension  and 
other cardiovascular diseases, certain cancers and psycho-social problems.

¾The imbalance between the energy intake and energy out put leads to excess 

accumulation of fat in various parts of the body.

What is desirable or ideal body weight or Body Mass Index (BMI)? 

There is no clear definition of a desirable or ideal body weight. Body weight for a 
given height of person with good health and long lifespan is considered as Ideal 
body weight. A much simpler and more acceptable measure is the ratio of weight 
and height, which estimates total body mass and correlates highly with the % of 
body fat. The most commonly used ratio is the BMI. It is computed by dividing the 
weight in kilograms by the square of the height in meters [BMI = Weight (kg) ÷ 
(Height M) ]. The ideal ranges of weights for a given height are provided by WHO 
(annexure 5), which is useful for categorizing persons as normal (ideal), under-
nourished and overweight or obese. 
What is obesity?  

2

Definition of obesity is based on the degree of excess fat. More than a general 
accumulation, the distribution of fat around the abdomen is now considered to be 
more  harmful  than  fat  around  the  hips.  Accumulation  of  fat  around  abdomen 
indicated by higher waist circumference is considered as risk factor. In general, BMI 
ranging  from  18.5  to  25  is  considered  to  be  normal.  However,  for Asians  it  is 
recommended that the BMI should be between 18.5 and 23, since, they tend to have 
higher  percentage  body  fat  even  at  lower  BMI  compared  to  Caucasians  and 
Europeans, which puts them at higher risk of chronic non-communicable diseases.

The  cut-off  levels  for  categorizing  overweight  and  obesity  in  children  and 
Since, growth spurt in boys and girls occurs in different 
adolescents are different. 
age groups, age and gender specific BMI centiles of reference population is used to 
assess  their  nutritional  status. Thus,  children  with  BMI  less  than  5   centile  are 
=5  and <85  centiles are normal, and 
considered as undernurished and those with 
with =85  and <95  centile are considered as overweight. More than 95  centile are 
considered as obese.

The  waist  circumference  and  waist-to-hip  ratios  are  useful  for  estimation  of 
central and truncal obesity respectively. Several studies have shown that the central 
obesity  was  directly  correlated  with  chronic  degenerative  diseases  especially 
metabolic syndrome. Waist-to-hip ratio of more than 0.9 among men and 0.8 in 
women and waist circumference 90cm for men and 80cm for women are associated 
with  increased risk of several chronic diseases especially in Asian Indians. 
Why should we avoid obesity? 

There  are  several  health  consequences  of  obesity.  Excessive  body  weight 
increases the risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, gallstones, certain types 
of cancers and osteoarthritis. Obesity invariably predisposes to reduced levels of 
high density lipoproteins ('good' cholesterol) and to increased levels of low density 
lipoproteins ('bad' cholesterol), and triglycerides, besides an abnormal increase in 
glucose  and  insulin  levels  in  blood.  Considering  the  increasing  trend  in  the 
prevalence of coronary artery disease, hypertension and diabetes in India, it is 
important to maintain desirable body weight for height and avoid obesity. 
What causes obesity ?   

Over-feeding  during  infancy,  childhood  and  adolescence  predisposes  to 
overweight/ obesity during adulthood. The tendency of familial obesity seems to be 
inherited. Eating junk or unhealthy foods 
coupled  with  low  physical  activity  is 
considered  as  a  main  contributor. 
Complex behavioral and psychological 
factors influence the eating patterns. In 
addition,  metabolic  errors  in  energy 
utilization  may  favor  fat  accumulation. 
Insulin is an important modifier of energy 
and  fat  metabolism 
fat 
deposition.  Low  and  high  birth  weight 

favoring 

53

(<2500 g and >3500g), obesity during childhood and adolescence are likely to lead 
to obesity in adults. It is therefore, necessary to maintain a desirable body weight by 
consuming  just  enough  calories  or  adjust  physical  activity  to  maintain  energy 
balance (intake = output). Body weight must, therefore, be checked and monitored 
periodically. 

Several  studies  have  suggested  that  hours  spent  in  watching  television  is 
strongly associated with weight gain in childhood and adolescents, mostly due to the 
sedentary behavior, tendency to consume snack foods while watching television 
and influence of the advertisements of energy dense foods.

Adults usually tend to gain weight between the ages of 25-50 years. In women, 

obesity develops just around pregnancy and after menopause. 
How to reduce body weight?

There is no single regimen for weight reduction; it has to be individualized. 
Weight reduction should be gradual. Weight reduction diets should not be less than 
1000 Kcal/day and provide all nutrients. A reduction of half a kilogram body weight 
per week is considered to be safe. Extreme approaches should be avoided and use 
of drugs may be dangerous. In children, obesity should be controlled by increasing 
physical activity rather than restricting food intake. Modifications in dietary habits 
have to be incorporated into one's lifestyle along with adequate exercise to keep the 
body weight within the normal limits. 

As fat contains more than twice the calories (9Kcal) per gram compared to 
protein (4Kcal) and carbohydrate (4Kcal), weight reducing diets should limit the fat 
intake.  Refined  sugars  (4Kcal)  and  alcohol  (7Kcal)  provide  empty  calories  and 
should  be  avoided.  Refined  carbohydrates  which  promote  fast  absorption  of 
glucose (Glycemic carbohydrates) also need to be restricted (Annexure 10). Plant 
foods  that  provide  complex  carbohydrates  and  fibre  may  be  preferred  as  they 
reduce blood glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides. Weight- reducing diets must be 
rich in proteins and low in carbohydrates and fats. Consumption of plenty of fruits 
and  vegetables  would  not  only  result  in  satiety  but  could  also  help  to  maintain 
adequate  micronutrient  intake.  Frequent  fasting/  semi-fasting  (cyclic  weight 
reduction) followed by adequate or excess food consumption will also aggravate the 
problem of weight gain. All reducing regimens should be monitored by a doctor and a 
dietitian.

How much of physical exercise is needed?

It  is  recommended  to  carry  out  at  least  45  minutes  of  physical  activity  of 
moderate-intensity for at least 5 days in a week. This amount of physical activity may 
reduce the risk of some chronic diseases. To lose weight, experts recommend that at 
least 60 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity be taken on 
most days of the week. In addition, one should follow a nutritious eating plan and 
consume fewer calories. Therefore, it is essential to remember that the body weight 

56

is affected by the balance of “calories-consumed” and “calories-burned.” Those, 
who are on low calorie diets for body weight reduction should have moderate to 
vigorous intensity physical activities at least for 60-90 minutes daily. Physical activity 
is essential for successful long-term weight management and will depend on current 
BMI and health condition (Annexure 11).
Levels of physical activity 

There are two basic levels of physical activity.

Moderate:
This  includes  walking  briskly  (about  5-6  KM  in  an  hour),  climbing, 
gardening/yard  work,  dancing,  walking  short  distances  for  fetching  milk  and 
vegetables, bicycling (about 16 KM in an hour), and weight training (a general light 
workout), yogasanas and pranayama, playing with children.
Vigorous:
Examples are running/jogging (7 KM in an hour), cycling (> 16 KM in an 
hour), swimming (freestyle laps), aerobics, brisk walking (6 KM in an hour), weight 
lifting (vigorous effort), competitive sports and heavy yard work, such as digging, 
cutting wood.

The  approximate  energy  costs  of  various  physical  activities  in  different 

intensities for a 60 kg person are given in annexure-11. 

If a physical activity does not increase the heart rate, it is not intense enough to be 
counted in the category of “45 minutes of exercise a day”. Activities that do not 
increase the heart rate include walking at a casual pace, grocery shopping, and 
doing light household chores.
Types of physical activities

These activities are very beneficial to health.

Aerobic activities

These  speed  your  heart  rate  and  breathing  while  improving  heart  and  lung 

fitness. Examples: brisk walking, jogging and swimming.
Resistance, strength building and weight-bearing activities 

These help build and maintain bones and muscles by working them against 

gravity. Lifting weights, walking with child in arms are a few examples.
Balance and stretching activities 

Dancing, gentle stretching, yoga, martial arts and Tai chi reduce risk of injuries 

by improving physical stability and flexibility.

Health Benefits of Physical Activity

?Controls body weight and composition.
?Reduces risk chronic diseases, such as Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, 

heart disease, osteoporosis, arthritis and certain types of cancers.

?Builds strong muscles, bones and joints.
?Improves flexibility.
?Wards off depression.
?Improves mood, sense of well-being and self esteem.

Regard movement as an opportunity and not an inconvenience

Children and teenagers need at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day. 
In the case of pregnant women 30 minutes or more of moderate-intensity physical 
activity  every  day  is  recommended.  However,  it  should  be  undertaken  in 
consultation  with  the  physician.  Like  others,  geriatric  population  also  will  be 
benefitted  considerably  by  physical  activity,  which  will  help  in  the  reduction  of 
functional impairment and improve lean body mass.

58

People  with  heart  disease,  high  blood  pressure,  diabetes,  asthma, 
osteoporosis and obesity should consult physician before taking up the exercise 
program. Men over 40 and women over 50 should also consult doctor or health care 
provider before starting a vigorous physical activity program.

Guideline 10

Restrict salt intake to minimum

Rationale: 

Increased salt intake may pose health risk and may lead to 
hypertension and heart disease

Sodium is the major electrolyte in the extra-cellular fluid. 

·
·Sodium plays an important role in nerve conduction and fluid balance in the 

body. 

·Maintenance of sodium balance depends on kidney function. 
·High intake of salt (sodium chloride) is associated with high blood pressure 

and stomach cancer.  

·All foods contain sodium. Sodium requirements can be met with moderate 

salt intake.

·Sodium intake needs to be balanced by potassium intake.

Salt  is  an  essential  ingredient  of  food  and  enhances  its  taste.  From  time 
immemorial, it has been used as a preservative. All food substances contain sodium, 
but added salt (sodium 40%, chloride 60%) is the major source of sodium in our diet. 
Sodium is primarily involved in the maintenance of water balance and equilibrium. It 
also plays an important role in electro-physiological functions of the cell. Humans 
have powerful in-built mechanisms for maintaining blood pressure even on minimal 
sodium intake.  

Sodium is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and a positive balance 
is  achieved  on  intakes  just  above  minimal  requirements.  Sodium  requirements 
depend  on  its  losses  through  urine,  faeces  and  sweat.  The  sweat  loss  varies 
according to climatic conditions. High ambient temperatures and vigorous physical 
exercise increase sodium loss through sweat. Even after 6 hours of hard physical 
labor, which may generate 3 litres of sweat, the requirement of sodium chloride may 
not be more than 6 g/day.   
Sources of sodium

Natural diets, in general, provide about 300-400 mg of sodium a day. Cereals, 
pulses, vegetables, milk, animal and sea foods are the major sources of sodium. 
Indian data indicate that per capita consumption of salt ranges from less than 5g to 
30g/day in different States with almost 40% of population consuming about 10g/day. 

60

Since, the taste for salt is acquired, its consumption could be restricted right from an 
early age.

Preserved foods such as pickles, sun dried foods such as papads, sauces/ ketch 

up and canned foods contribute to higher intakes of salt. 
What are the health problems associated with excessive salt/sodium intake?

There  is  a  strong  association  between  salt  intake  and  blood  pressure. 
Prevalence of hypertension is low in populations consuming less than 3 g salt per 
day. The  usual  increase  in  blood  pressure  with  age  is  also  not  seen  with  such 
intakes.  The  amount  of  salt  consumed  is  reflected  in  urinary  sodium.  Drastic 
restriction of dietary salt decreases the risk of hypertension. However, this effect is 
not uniform as only 20-30% of population is salt sensitive. Potassium-rich foods 
such as fresh vegetables and fruits decrease blood pressure. In fact, it is the ratio of 
sodium to potassium in the diet which is important. Salt intake higher than 8 g/day is 
considered as a risk factor for hypertension.  

Besides  increasing  blood  pressure,  excessive  salt  may  also  affect  stomach 

mucosa and result in atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer.  

Higher sodium intake leads to greater calcium excretion which may result in 
reduction in bone density. Existing evidence reveals a deleterious impact of high salt 
intake on blood vessels, blood pressure, bones and gastrointestinal tract. Salt intake 
in our population generally exceeds the requirement. It should not be more than 6 g 
per day. Salt is used as a vehicle for food fortification since, it is commonly used in 
food preparation.

61

POINTS TO PONDER

ØRestrict the intake of added salt right from an early age.
ØDevelop a taste for foods/diets that are low in salt. 
ØRestrict intake of preserved and processed foods such as papads, 
pickles, sauces, ketch up, salted biscuits, chips, cheese and salted 
fish.

ØEat plenty of vegetables and fruits. They are good source of potassium.
ØUse always iron fortified iodized salt (double fortified salt).

Ensure the use of safe and clean foods

Guideline 11

Rationale:

Contaminated and adulterated f
several food-borne illnesses in the country

oods 

are major causes for 

ªSafe and good-quality foods are  essential for maintaining good health 
ªNaturally-occurring toxins, environmental contaminants and adulterants in 

foods constitute a health hazard. 

ªConsumption of unsafe foods can lead to food-borne diseases.  

What makes food unsafe?

Microbes  (bacteria  and  moulds)  and  their  products  are  responsible  for  food 
spoilage. Natural enzymes present in food also lead to its deterioration. Besides, 
insects, rodents, adulterants, natural toxins and various chemical residues beyond 
permissible  levels,  make  the  food  unwholesome.  In  addition  to  moisture  and 
environmental conditions like temperature, storage time also influence the quality of 
the food. 
How do we select safe food?

Selection of the right food is the first step to ensure safe and good quality diet. 
Food items purchased from reliable sources having a high turnover ensure their 
freshness. Some foods carry certification mark assuring good quality. For example 
AGMARK for honey and ghee; FPO (Fruit Products Order) for fruit and vegetable 
products (jams, squashes, etc); ISI (Bureau of Indian Standards) for food colours 
and essences. While purchasing packaged food always look for ‘best before’ or 
‘date of expiry’.

Food  grains  purchased  should  be  free  from  infestation  and  foreign  matter     

(rodent excreta and insect remains). They should be of uniform size and should not 
be shrivelled, shrunken or mouldy. Foodstuffs should be free from artificial colors. 
There is a risk of adulteration when fats/oils are purchased loose from unsealed 
containers. Therefore,  it  is  always  safer  to  purchase  reputed  brand  products  in 
sealed sachets/containers. It is necessary to buy pasteurized milk in sachets from a 
reputed dairy or a reliable vendor to avoid the risk of adulteration and contamination. 
Milk products such as butter, ghee and khoa should also be purchased from reliable 
sources. Whole spices, uniform in color, size and shape should be preferred. Since 
powdered spices are more likely to be adulterated, always buy certified products. 
Fruits and vegetables that show patches, physical damage with bruises or wilted 

63

and decayed with visible evidence of insects and moulds, should be avoided. Eggs 
should  be  fresh  and  free  from  cracks.  Meat  or  poultry  must  be  examined  for 
characteristic color, odor and texture and should be purchased fresh or frozen. 
Freshness of fresh-water fish is indicated by a stiff body, bright, clear and bulging 
eyes, reddish gills, tight scales and absence of stale odor or discoloration. Fresh fish 
will not show any pitting on finger pressure.
What are the best practices of storage ?

Agricultural  commodities  should  be  dried  and adequately  in  a  safe  storage 
structure, to protect them from moisture and to prevent the damage from microbs 
like bacteria and mould producing toxins (eg. aflatoxins). Rodent attacks, and the 
presence of insects and microbes, not only reduce the availability of nutrients but 
render  the  foods  harmful.  Frequent  and  careful  disinfestation  of  the  storage 
premises using rodenticides like aluminium phosphide is essential. Some traditional  
household practices such as application of edible oils to grains, placing dried neem 
leaves in storage bins etc., are known to prevent infestations. 
Why do foodborne diseases occur?

Foodborne infections and toxicities are common particularly  with consumption 
of susceptible foods such as milk products like khoa, meat, poultry and even cooked 
foods like rice. Improper processing, handling and cooking, and keeping cooked 
foods in warm conditions for several hours before eating, promote bacterial growth 
and toxin production.
How should perishable foods be handled ?

Perishable foods like milk, meat, vegetables and cooked foods, are prone to 
spoilage  due  to  microbes.  These  foods  should  be  stored  under  refrigeration, 
preferably  at  a  temperature  of  10 c  or  less,  which  retards  multiplication  of 
microorganisms. However, even refrigerated foods, if stored for long, can get spoilt. 
Cross contamination can be avoided by keeping cooked and raw foods separately. 

o

o

In case of food which is cooked, if not consumed immediately has to be stored for 
some time, it should be kept either hot (more than 60 c) or be cooled quickly (below 
10 c).  Most  micro-organisms  multiply  at  temperatures  between  10  and  60 c.   
Refrigerated  cooked  food  should  be  heated  before  consumption.  However, 
repeated heating may be avoided.  
What about personal hygiene ? 

o

o

Food handlers should observe good personal hygiene to maintain food safety.  
They should be free from obvious signs of illness, wounds and sores. Traditionally in 

64

India, cooked food is touched by bare hands while preparing, serving and eating. 
Use of spoons and ladles should be encouraged to avoid contamination. Hands 
should be washed thoroughly with soap before starting the preparation of food and 
after every interruption. Household pets like cats and dogs often harbour dangerous 
pathogens. They should be kept away from places where food is cooked, stored or 
served. 
What are the common adulterants?

Foods may be adulterated with non-food material or inferior quality product. 
Spoilt, stale or poor quality food is made attractive and fresh by adding harmful 
colors  or  other  chemicals.  Frequently  adulterated  food  items  are  milk  and  milk 
products, cereals, pulses and their products, edible oils and spices. The different 
classes of adulterants include non-permitted colors like metanil yellow; non-edible 
oils like castor oil; cheaper agricultural produce like various starches in milk powder; 
extraneous  matter  like  husk,  sand  and  sawdust;  and  metal  contaminants  like 
aluminum or iron filings. Consumption of adulterated foods could lead to disease 
outbreaks  of  epidemic  proportions.  Buying  from  a  reliable  and  reputed  source, 
careful checking of foods before purchase and insisting on certified brands will all 
minimize the risk of food adulteration.  
How to minimize effects of pesticide residues?

Pesticides,  used  during  cultivation  of  crops,  can 
remain as residues in foodstuffs, especially vegetables 
and  fruits.  Exposure  of  the  population  to  pesticide 
residues  may  be  harmful  and  can  be  minimized  by 
washing the foodstuffs thoroughly in running water 
or by peeling. Cooking and other processes can 
also  reduce  such  residues  (Annexure  12). 
Insect control operations such as disinfestation 
in the kitchen by spraying pesticides is another 
source of contamination. Utmost care should be 
taken to ensure that eatables are well covered and 
protected from exposure to such harmful agents. 

65

POINTS TO PONDER

²Buy food items from reliable sources after careful examination.  

Wash vegetables and fruits thoroughly before use. 

²
²Store  the  raw  and  cooked  foods  properly  and  prevent  microbial, 

rodent and insect invasion.  

²Refrigerate perishable food items. 
²Maintain  good  personal  hygiene  and  keep  the  cooking  and  food 

storage areas clean and safe.

Guideline 12

Adopt right pre-cooking processes and appropriate 

cooking methods

Rationale: 

Healthy and positive food concepts and cooking practices 
are foundation for good health

 

§Cultural factors play an important role in dietary practices. 
§Faulty food fads and beliefs adversely affect nutrition and health. 
§Cooking renders food palatable and helps in easy digestion. 
§Cooking destroys harmful germs. 
§Faulty pre-cooking and cooking process lead to loss of nutrients. 
§Cooking  at  high  temperatures  leads  to  destruction  of  nutrients  and 

formation of harmful substances.

What are common Indian food beliefs, fads and taboos?

Food habits are formed early in childhood, passed on from the elders in the 
family and perpetuated to adulthood. Food beliefs either encourage or discourage 
the consumption of particular type of foods. There can be neutral, harmless or 
harmful practices. Unfortunately, most of the food fads and prejudices (taboos) are 
associated  with  women  and  children,  who  are  also  the  most  vulnerable  to 
malnutrition. Exaggerated beneficial or harmful claims in respect of some foods, 
without scientific basis constitute food fads. In addition, the belief of heat producing 
and cold inducing foods is widely prevalent. Some examples are jaggery, sugar, 
groundnuts, fried foods, mango, bajra, jowar, maize, eggs and meat. Papaya fruit is 
strongly suspected to lead to abortion, though there is no scientific basis. Buttermilk, 
curd, milk, green gram dhal, green leafy vegetables, ragi, barley flour and apples 
are considered as cold inducing foods which are actually nutritious. Vegetarianism 
is often practiced in India on religious grounds. Since vitamin B  is present only in 
foods of animal origin, vegetarians should ensure an adequate consumption of milk. 
During certain illnesses like measles and diarrhea, dietary restriction is practiced. 
This can aggravate malnutrition in young children.
What are the effects of the pre-cooking processes?

12

Foods,  in  their  natural  state,  contain  different  nutrients  in  varying  amounts.   
Cooking  improves  the  digestibility  of  most  foods.  Flesh  foods  get  softened  on 
cooking and become easily chewable. Proper methods of cooking render foods 

67

palatable by improving the appearance, taste, flavor and texture, thereby enhancing 
acceptability. In addition, they help in destroying disease causing organisms and 
eliminating  natural  inhibitors  of  digestion.  In  the  course  of  food  preparation, 
depending  on  the  recipe,  foods  are  subjected  to  various  processes  such  as 
washing, grinding, cutting, fermentation, germination and cooking. In the Indian 
cuisine, fermentation (idli, dosa, dhokla) and germination (sprouting) are common 
practices. These  methods  improve  digestibility  and  increase  nutrients  such  as 
B-complex vitamins and vitamin C. 
What are the effects of washing and cutting ?

Foods  should  be  washed  well  before  cooking  and  consumption  to  remove 
contaminants  like  pesticide  residues,  parasites  and  other  extraneous  material 
(Annexure 12). However, certain precautions need to be taken while washing and 
cutting to minimize the loss of nutrients. Repeated washing of food grains like rice 
and pulses results in losses of certain minerals and vitamins. Vegetables and fruits 
should  be  washed  thoroughly  with  potable  water  before  cutting.  Cutting  of 
vegetables in to small pieces exposes a greater surface area of the foodstuff to the 
atmosphere, resulting in loss of vitamins due to oxidation. Therefore, vegetables 
should be cut in to large pieces. Cut vegetables should not be soaked in water for 
long, as water-soluble minerals and vitamins get dissolved. 
What are the effects of cooking ?

There are many methods of cooking like boiling, steaming, pressure cooking, 
frying, roasting and baking. Boiling is the most common method of cooking, during 
which heat-labile and water-soluble vitamins like vitamin B-complex and C is lost. 
The practice of using excess water while cooking rice should be discouraged since it 
leads to loss of vitamins; just sufficient water to be fully absorbed should be used. 
Use  of  baking  soda  for  hastening  cooking  of  pulses 
should  not  be  practiced,  as  it  results  in  loss  of 
vitamins. Frying involves cooking food 
in  oil/ghee/vanaspati  at  high 
temperatures.  Shallow 
frying 
involves  use  of  much  smaller 
amounts of oils than deep frying. 
Repeated  heating  of  oils 
particularly  PUFA-rich  oils 
results  in 
formation  of 
peroxides  and  free  radicals 
and, hence, should be avoided 

68

by using just enough oil. Similarly, oils which have been repeatedly heated should 
not be mixed with fresh oil but should be used for process such as seasoning. 
Microwave Cooking 

Microwave cooking is convenient, fast and preserves nutrients and also useful 
in reheating of food. But it can reheat or cook unevenly and leave some cold spots in 
the food by which harmful bacteria can enter into our body. So it is discouraged to 
use large amounts or big pieces in the microwave oven otherwise mix the food in 
between for even heating or cooking. Never use partially heated food. Don't cook 
frozen food in the microwave oven directly as it leaves some parts of the food 
partially cooked. 

Always use glass or pottery dishes and food grade microwave friendly plastic 
dishes and wrap to re-heat foods. Approximate calorific value of some cooked food 
preparation are given in annexure 8.

Why do we need water?

Water accounts for 70% of our body weight. It is a constituent of blood and other 
vital body fluids. Water plays a key role in elimination of body wastes and regulation 
of body temperature. The body loses water through sweat, urine and faeces. This 
loss must be constantly made good with clean and potable water. A normal healthy 
person needs to drink about 8 glasses (2 litre) of water per day. During very hot 
weather and while undertaking vigorous physical activity, this requirement increases 
as a considerable amount of water is lost through sweat.  
When is water considered safe and wholesome ?

Water should be safe and wholesome i.e., it should be free from disease-causing 
agents like bacteria, viruses, parasites etc., and harmful chemical substances like 
pesticides, industrial wastes, heavy metals, nitrates, arsenic and excess of fluoride. 
Fluorosis,  a  disease  with  bone  deformities  and  dental  problems,  results  from 
drinking  water  containing  an  excess  of  fluoride  over  long  periods.  Generally,  a 
concentration of 0.5 to 0.8 mg of fluoride per litre of drinking water is considered safe.
How is water rendered safe ?

If  a  water  source  is  not  safe  for  drinking,  boiling  it  for  10-15  minutes  is  a 
satisfactory method of purification of the water. It kills all disease-causing organisms 
and  also  removes  temporary  hardness.  However,  boiling  will  not  remove  other 
chemical impurities. Tablets containing 0.5g of chlorine can disinfect 20 litres of water. 
There are many modern gadgets which claim to provide safe and wholesome water. 
However,  they  vary  in  efficacy. Drinking water standards given in annexure-13.

How nutritious is milk ?

Milk is a well accepted and wholesome food and beverage for all age groups. It 
contains  most  of  the  nutrients  necessary  for  growth  and  development.  It  is, 
therefore,  specially  useful  or  feeding  infants,  toddlers,  growing  children  and 
expectant  women  and  nursing  mothers. All  the  macro  and  micro-nutrients  are 
present in an easily digestible and assimilable form in milk. Milk proteins possess 
high biological value which is almost equal to that of meat, eggs and other high-
quality animal proteins. Milk proteins are valuable supplements to most vegetarian 
diets. 

Milk is a rich source of bioavailable calcium which helps in the building up of 
strong bones. Milk fat serves as a vehicle for important fat-soluble vitamins A, D and 
E. Since, milk fat is of the saturated type those who have to be on a low fat diet can  
consume skimmed/toned milk. For strict vegetarians, milk is the only source of 
vitamin B . Milk is also rich in riboflavin, but is a poor source of vitamins C and iron. 
However, only pasteurized or boiled milk should be consumed to ensure protection 
from disease-causing agents.
What is lactose intolerance ?

12

Lactose, the sugar present in milk, helps in the establishment of lactic acid 
bacteria in the intestinal tract. If lactase, an enzyme required for digestion of lactose, 
is not present in sufficient amounts, such individuals develop abdominal symptoms 
on consumption of excess of milk. This is common in children following diarrhea and 
is described as lactose intolerance. Drinking small quantities of milk at a time does 
not usually cause any gastrointestinal problems and there is no need to discourage 
intake of milk by children except in severe cases of diarrhea. 
What are soft drinks ?

Soft drinks are generally of two categories, natural soft drinks and artificial or 
synthetic soft drinks. Water is the main constituent of all beverages. Orange, lemon, 
grape, mango, pineapple and apple are generally used in making fruit juice. sugar 
cane juice is also extensively used in India, particularly during summer. Natural fruit 
juices provide in addition to energy, some vitamins (beta-carotenes, vitamin C) and 
minerals  (potassium,  calcium).  Fruit  juices  being  potassium  rich  are  ideal 
beverages for those suffering from hypertension. However, they cannot be equated 
with fruits which also provide dietary fibre. 

Compared to natural fruit juices, synthetic drinks do not contain nutrients unless 
they  are  fortified.  Generally,  synthetic  drinks  are  prepared  using  preservatives, 
artificial colors and flavors such as cola, orange, mango and lime, and mostly they 

71

are carbonated. Carbonated beverages  contain phosphoric acid 
and may damage the enamel of teeth, and affect appetite if taken 
in excessive  amounts.  Water used for preparation of beverages 
should  be  free  from  disease-causing  agents  and  harmful 
chemical impurities. 

Beverages  like  buttermilk,  lassi,  fruit 
juices  and  coconut  water  are  better 
alternatives to synthetic drinks.
What about tea and coffee ?

Tea and coffee are popular beverages. 

They  are  known  to  relieve  mental  and  muscular  fatigue.  This  characteristic 
stimulating effect is due to their caffeine content. A cup (150 ml) of brewed coffee 
contains 80-120 mg of caffeine and instant coffee 50-65 mg, while tea contains 30-
65  mg  of  caffeine.  Caffeine  stimulates  the  central  nervous  system  and  induces 
physiological dependence. 

Generally, low doses (20-200 mg) of caffeine produce mild positive effects like a 
feeling of well-being, alertness and being energetic. Higher doses (>200 mg) can 
produce negative effects like nervousness and anxiety, especially in people who do 
not usually consume caffeine-containing beverages. Therefore, moderation in tea 
and coffee consumption is advised so that caffeine intake does not exceed the 
tolerable limits. Tannin is also present in tea and coffee and is known to interfere with 
iron absorption. Hence, tea and coffee should be avoided at least for one hour before 
and after meals.    

Excess consumption of coffee is known to increase blood pressure and cause 
abnormalities in heart beat. In addition, an association between coffee consumption 
and elevated levels of total and LDL cholesterol ('bad' cholesterol), triglycerides and 
heart disease has been demonstrated. Therefore, individuals with heart disease 
need to restrict coffee consumption. Also, those who experience adverse effects 
from caffeine should stop drinking coffee.  

Besides caffeine, tea contains theobromine and theophylline. These are known 
to  relax  coronary  arteries  and  thereby  promote  circulation.  Tea  also  contains 
flavonoids and other antioxidant polyphenols, which are known to reduce the risk for 
coronary heart disease and stomach cancer. However, as a result of its caffeine 
content, excess tea consumption is deleterious to health. Decaffeinated coffee and 
tea are being marketed to obviate the adverse effects of caffeine. 

72

Tender coconut water

Tender coconut water is a nutritious beverage. It has a caloric 
value  of  17.4  per  100  gm.  The  concentration  of  sugar  steadily 
increases from 1.5% to about 5.5% in the early months of maturation 
and this slowly falls to about 2% at the stage of full maturity. 
Tender coconut water contains most of the minerals such as 
potassium  (290  mg%),  Sodium  (42  mg%),  Calcium  (44 
mg%),  magnesium  (10  mg%),  Phosphorus  (9.2  mg%), 
iron  (106  mg%),and  copper  (26  mg%).  It  is  an  oral 
rehydration medium and keeps the body cool. However, in 
patients  with  hyper  kalemia  such  as  renal  failure,  acute 
adrenal insufficiency and in patients with low urine output, TCW should be avoided.
Alcohol

Alcoholic beverages contain ethyl alcohol in varying proportions. Beer contains 
2-5% and wine 8-10% of alcohol, while brandy, rum and whisky contain much higher 
concentrations  (30-40%). Alcohol  has  been  extensively  abused  as  an  appetite 
stimulant and as a sedative-hypnotic drug. Alcohol intake, which is initiated as an 
innocent social habit may gradually result in a serious addiction. It may lead to 
several serious psycho-social problems and accidents.  

Alcohol provides higher calories (7 Kcal/g) than 
carbohydrates and proteins and thus, can contribute 
to  obesity.  Ironically,  excessive  intake  of  alcohol  is 
known  to  suppress  appetite  and  interfere  with 
absorption  and  metabolism  of  nutrients,  leading  to 
various nutritional deficiency diseases.  

Excessive intake of alcohol suppresses appetite 
and as a result, leads to several nutritional deficiency 
diseases. People who regularly consume more than 
two  alcoholic  drinks  (one  equals  about  30  ml  of 
ethanol) are at a higher risk for hypertension and stroke. Alcohol intake has also 
been shown to increase the risk of cancer of the mouth, larynx and oesophagus, 
prostate and of the breast in women. Excessive alcohol intake weakens the heart 
muscle  (cardiomyopathy)  and  also  damages  the  liver  (cirrhosis),  brain  and 
peripheral nerves. It also increases serum triglycerides.

Minimize the use of processed foods rich in salt, 

Guideline 14

sugar and fats

Rationale:

Processed foods being rich in fats, salt, sugar and preserva-
tives may pose a health risk if consumed regularly

?Urbanization has increased the intake and demand for processed foods. 
?There is a trend towards replacing traditionally cooked foods with processed 

foods. 

?Processed foods may not be nutritionally balanced unless fortified.
?Sugar, a processed food, provides empty calories.

What are processed foods?

to 

foods, 

Foods  that  are  subjected 

technological 
modifications either for preservation or for converting 
into  ready-to-use/eat  foods,  eliminating  laborious 
household procedures, are called “processed foods”. 
Some of the examples are ready mixes, dehydrated 
foods,  pasta  products,  canned 
confectioneries,  bakery,  dairy  products 
and  breakfast  foods.  Manufacture  of 
processed  foods  requires  technology 
application  and  machinery,  and  as  a 
result, processed foods are expensive. 
Do we need processed foods?
  There is an increased demand for processed, ready-to-eat and convenience 
foods due to changes in lifestyle. As more and more women go to work outside, and 
families  have  become  nuclear,  consumption  of  processed  foods,  particularly  in 
urban areas, will be on the increase. Today's consumer is looking for convenient, 
easy-to-cook,  and  ready-to-eat  foods  which  require  less  time  to  prepare  than 
traditional  home-cooked  foods.  Food  processing  is  must  to  preserve  highly 
perishable  products  like  milk,  meat,  fish  and  fresh  fruits  and  vegetables.  Food 
processing  increases  the  seasonal  availability  of  foods  and  enables  easy 
transportation and distribution over long distances.

75

Do processed foods contribute to nutrient intake?

Processed foods are generally consumed either as part of a meal, or as a snack 
item.  Their  contribution  in  terms  of  essential  nutrients  depends  on  the  type  of 
processing  and  fortification,  the  frequency  of  use,  and  the  quantity  consumed.   
Processed foods are generally refined and a majority of them are rich in fat or in 
salt/sugar, and are calorie dense. They lack dietary fibre and micronutrients. Thus, 
caution needs to be  exercised when processed foods constitute a major part of the  
meal. 

Breakfast  cereals  are  increasingly  being  used  in  urban  areas.  Traditional 
breakfast items like idli, dosa, upma and roti are rich sources of nutrients. Puffed and 
parched rice products (eg. flaked rice) besides being crisp and tasty, are easily 
digestible. Food items like chips, candies, peppermints, chocolates, etc., which are 
popular  among  children,  are  considered  as  unhealthy  since,  they  provide  only   
empty calories often containing artificial colors and other additives. Their use should 
be discouraged.
What is the difference between instant foods, fast foods, street foods and 
unhealthy (junk) foods?
Instant foods

Instant foods are those, which undergo special processing designed to dissolve or 
to disperse particles more rapidly in a liquid than the untreated product. For instance, 
instant  noodles,  soup  powders,  cornflakes  fall  under  this  category. Although  all 
instant foods need not be unhealthy in terms of high calorie or salt contents, there are 
concerns about the presence of certain additives like monosodium glutamate, which 
may also add up to the over-all sodium intake from the foods. 
Fast Foods

Fast  foods  are  foods  already  made  or  cooked  to  order  within  minutes  for 
consumption like noodles, burgers, fried fish, milk shakes, chips, salads, pizzas, 
sandwiches, etc. Storage, handling and microbiological contamination are the major 
concerns. Further they are calorie dense foods.
Street Foods

Street foods comprises of a wide range of ready-to-eat foods and beverages 
prepared and/or sold by vendors and hawkers, especially on streets and other public 
places. Idly, Wada, Dosa, Chat Items etc are examples of street foods. They may be 
contaminated with pathogenic organisms unless hygienically prepared.  

76

Unhealthy (Junk) Foods

Unhealthy foods are those containing little or no proteins, vitamins or minerals but 
are rich in salt, sugar, fats and are high in energy (calories). Some examples are 
chocolates, artificially flavored aerated drinks, potato chips, ice creams, french fries 
etc.
Why should we restrict intake of unhealthy processed foods?

Frequent  consumption  of  unhealthy  processed  food  increases  calorie  intake 
without  providing  any  nutrients,  vitamins  and  minerals.  Apart  from  being  non-
nutritious, processed foods also contain food additives. Food additives consumed 
beyond permissible limits may have adverse effects on health. The national food 
regulatory  authorities  periodically  review  these  limits.  Thus,  consumption  of 
processed foods may not only affect intake of nutrients, but in addition, increase the 
risk of exposure to various chemical additives. 

In  the  coming  years,  with  larger  constraints  on  time  at  home,  demand  for 
processed foods is certain to increase. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that 
intake of a nutritionally balanced diet is not compromised with unwise intake of 
various  processed  and  convenience  foods.  Processed  vegetables  and  fruits 
available in the market are no match to nutrient rich fresh vegetables and fruits.
Why should we moderate intake of sugar ?

Sugars occur both naturally and as an ingredient in many foods. They are present 
in natural foods like fruits, vegetables, milk and honey. Added sugars provide taste 
and texture to foods. Sugar is present in processed foods like chocolates, jams, ice-
creams and soft drinks. The most familiar sugar is sucrose. Refined or table sugar 
(sucrose) provides “empty calories”. Foods such as cakes, pastries, confectionery 
and sweets often have high amounts of fat, and sugar, and are prepared with refined 
cereals. Excess consumption of sugary foods may lead to obesity and elevated 
blood lipids. Children overindulging in chocolates and candies are prone to dental 
carries. For prevention of diet-related chronic diseases, sugars and refined cereals 
should be sparingly used. 

77

POINTS TO PONDER

¹Prefer traditional, home made foods. 

Avoid replacing meals with snack foods.  

¹
¹Limit consumption of sugar and unhealthy processed foods which 

provide only (empty) calories. 

¹Prefer fortified processed foods.
¹Always read food labels (given on containers) regarding content of 

nutrients, shelf-life and the additives present.

78

Guideline 15

Include micronutrient rich foods in the diets of elderly 

people to enable them to be fit and active

Rationale:

Senior  citizens  need  more  of  vitamins  and  minerals  to 
remain healthy and active

÷Body  composition  changes  with  advancing  age,  and  these  changes  affect 

nutritional needs of the elderly.

÷Elderly  or  aged  people  require  reduced  amounts  of  calories,  as  their  lean 

muscle mass and physical activity decrease with ageing.   

÷Elderly are more prone to diseases due to lowered food intake, physical activity 

and resistance to infection. 

÷Good /healthy food habits and regular comfortable level of physical activity are 

required to minimise the ill effects of ageing and to improve the quality of life. 

÷Elderly  need  adequate  amounts  of  protein,  carbohydrates,  fat,  vitamins, 

minerals and dietary fibre. 

÷Elderly need more calcium, iron, zinc, vitamin A and antioxidants to prevent 

age-related degenerative diseases and for healthy ageing. 

Who is an elderly person?

Individuals of 60 years and above (WHO) constitute the elderly. In India, the 
elderly constitute about 7 percent of the total population (Census, 2001) and by 2016 
and by they are likely to increase to 10 percent.  
How are the elderly different?

Ageing affects almost all the systems of the body, and is associated 
with several physiological, metabolic and psychological changes. The 
changes incude decline in physical activity, digestion, metabolism, bone 
mass and muscle mass. Failing eye-sight and impaired hearing may also 
occur. Low appetite as a result of loss of taste and smell perception, 
dental problems, atrophic changes in GIT, constipation and decreased 
physical activity could lead to overall decrease of food intake and poor 
absorption of nutrients. Inability to prepare food, economic dependency 
and  other  psycho-social  problems  adversely  affects  the  health  and 
nutritional status of the elderly.

There is a decline in immune function with advancing age, which leads to 
decreased resistance to  infectious diseases. The  increased parathyroid 

79

hormone  (PTH)  secretion  in  the  elderly  leads  to  increased  bone  turn  over  i.e. 
osteoporosis. Similarly, elderly individuals are at increased risk of osteomalacia i.e. 
defective bone mineralization due to lack of exposure to sunlight and poor diet.
How can the elderly lead an active life?

In general, majority of the health problems among the elderly are nutrition related. 
Consumption of nutritious foods rich in micronutrients including antioxidant vitamins 
& minerals and fibre, comfortable level of physical activity would enable the elderly to 
live active and meaningful healthy lives, without being a burden on society and their 
family members. Uncomplicated ageing can also be quite productive, say in the 
domestic sphere. 
What are the common diseases among the elderly?

Resistance to disease declines in the elderly. The common ailments in the elderly 
are  degenerative  diseases  such  as  arthritis  (joint  diseases),  osteoporosis, 
osteomalacia, cataract, diabetes, cardiovascular (stroke, heart diseases) problems, 
neurological  (Parkinson's,  Alzheimer's)  and  psychiatric  (dementia,  depression, 
delirium) disorders and cancer.  Besides these, the prevalence of respiratory, gastro 
intestinal tract (GIT) and urinary tract infections is common among the elderly. 
What type of diet should the elderly eat?

As  people  grow  older,  they  tend  to  become  physiologically  less  active  and 
therefore need fewer calories to maintain their weights. The daily intake of oil should 
not exceed 20 g. Use of ghee, butter, vanaspati and coconut oil should be avoided. 
They need foods rich in protein such as pulses, toned milk, egg-white etc. The 
elderly population is prone to various nutritional deficiencies. Therefore, the elderly 
need nutrient-rich foods rich in calcium, micro-nutrients and fibre. Apart from cereals 
and pulses, they need daily at least 200-300 ml of milk and milk products and 400 g 
of vegetables and fruits to provide fibre, micro-nutrients and antioxidants. Inclusion 
of these items in the diet improves the quality of the diet and bowel function. Flesh 
foods and eggs add to the quality of diet (annexure 14 & 15 ).

The diet needs to be well cooked, soft and less salty and spicy. Small quantities of 
food should be consumed at more frequent intervals and adequate water should be 
consumed to avoid dehydration, hyponatraemia and constipation.
How can elderly remain fit and active ?

Exercise is an integral part of maintaining healthy life. It helps to regulate body 
weight. The risk of degenerative diseases is considerably decreased by regular 
exercise. Exercise schedule should be decided in consultation with a physician.

Exercise and Physical Activity

Annexure - 11

Adults  over  the  age  of  20  years  should  undertake  a  minimum  of  30-45  minutes  of 
physical activity of moderate intensity (such as brisk walking 5-6 km/hr) 5-6 days of the week. 
Greater health benefits can be obtained by engaging in physical activity of longer duration or 
more vigorous intensity such as jogging, running, cycling and swimming.

Sedentary  people  embarking  on  a  physical  activity  programme  should  undertake  a 
moderate intensity activity of short duration to start with and gradually increase the duration 
or intensity. Other day-to-day activities like walking, housework, gardening, will be beneficial 
not only in weight reduction but also for lowering of blood pressure and serum triglycerides. It 
also  elevates  HDL  (good)  cholesterol  in  blood.  Simple  modification  in  lifestyle  like 
deliberately climbing up the stairs instead of using the lift and walking for short distance 
instead of using a vehicle could also immensely help in increasing our physical activity.

Exercise program should include 'warm up' and 'cool down' periods each lasting for 5 
minutes. During exercise, the intensity of exercise should ensure 60-70% increase in heart 
rate.

Inactive men over the age of 40 years, women over the age of 50 years and people at 
high risk for chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes should first consult a physician 
before engaging in a program of vigorous physical activity such as running and swimming.

Forty five minutes per day of moderate intensity physical activity provides many 
health benefits. However, even greater health benefits can be gained through more 
vigorous  exercise  or  by  staying  active  for  a  longer  time.  This  also  burns  more 
calories. Regardless of the activity being selected, one can do it all at once or divide 
it into two or three parts during the day.

Removal of the Pesticide Residues from the Food Products by 

Different Methods

Annexure - 12

Most  of  the  pesticide  residues  can  be  removed  by  adopting  four  methods.   
These methods should be easily adopted at the house hold level to remove the 
pesticide residues. These methods are washing, blanching, peeling and cooking.  

Washing

The first step in the removal of pesticide residues from the food products is 
washing. About 75-80% of pesticide residues are removed by cold water washing. 
Washing with 2% of salt water will remove most of the contact pesticide residues that 
normally appear on the surface of the vegetables and fruits.  

The pesticide residues that are on the surface of the grapes, apples, guava, 
plums, mangoes, peaches, pears etc, vegetables like tomatoes, brinjal, okra require 
2-3 washings. The green leafy vegetables must be washed with 2% salt water. The 
pesticide residues from green leafy vegetables is removed satisfactorily by normal 
processing such as washing, blanching and cooking.

Blanching

Blanching is a short treatment in hot water or steam applied to most of the 
vegetables. Certain pesticide residues can effectively be removed by blanching.   
But before blanching it is very important to thoroughly pre-wash the vegetables and 
fruits.  

Peeling 

Contact pesticides that appear on the surface of the fruits and vegetables can be 
removed by peeling. Steps such as concentration, dehydration, and extraction from 
the raw product can further reduce pesticide residues in the end produce. The net 
influence of processing almost always results in minimal residues in processed 
food.

114

Cooking

Animal Products

Animal  products  are  also  the  major  source  of  contamination  for  pesticide 
residues in human diets since the animals feed on fodder, which are sprayed with 
pesticides.   Pressure cooking, frying and baking will minimize the harmful effect 
pesticide residues.  

Dairy products 

Boiling  of  milk  at  high  temperatures  will  destroy  the  persistent  pesticide 

residues.  

Vegetable Oils   

Refined oils will have fewer amounts of pesticide residues.  Household heating 

of oils will minimize pesticide residues.

Glossary

Allergic  reaction  :  Immunologically  induced  tissue  response  to  a  foreign  substance 
(allergen).

Alpha-linolenic acid : 18 carbon fatty acid with three double bonds; the first double bond is 
on the third carbon atom from the methyl end and therefore it is called n-3 fatty acid.  It is 
abbreviated as 18: 3 n-3. 

Amino acid : The fundamental building block of proteins.

Anabolism : Process by which complex materials in tissues and organs are built up from 
simple substances. 

Antioxidants :  A group of substances that prevent the damage caused by the oxidation of 
fatty acids and proteins by oxygen free radicals. 

Atherosclerosis :   Gradual deposition of fatty materials and fibrous tissues in the inner 
lining of the arteries with eventual obstruction of blood flow. 

Balanced Diet  : A  diet  containing  all  essential  (macro  and  micro)  nutrients  in  optimum 
quantities and in appropriate proportions that meet the requirements. 

Beta-Carotene : A yellow - orange plant pigment which yields vitamin A by oxidation in the 
body.

Bifidus factor : A substance in human milk which stimulates the growth of a micro-organism 
(Lactobacillus bifidus) in the infants' intestine. 

Body Mass Index :  Body weight in relation to height. Body weight in kilograms divided by 
height in metres . 

2

Calorie :   Unit used to indicate the energy value of foods. Quantitative requirements are 
expressed in terms of energy, i.e., kilocalories (Kcals). Newer unit for energy is Kjoules. 

Catabolism : Process of breakdown of complex organic constituents in the body.

Cataract :  An opacity of the lens of the eye resulting in impaired vision. 

Cholesterol : A lipid constituent of blood and tissues derived from diet as well as from 
synthesis within the body. 

123

Cirrhosis : Inflammation and scarring of liver tissues resulting in impaired liver function.

Colostrum :  The milk produced by mammals during the first few days after delivery. 

Congenital anomalies : Deformities existing at birth or even before. 

Coronary heart disease : A disease of the heart due to inadequate blood supply as a result 
of narrowing/obstruction of coronary arteries which nourish heart muscle. 

CU : Consumption Unit. One unit represents Recommended Dietary Allowance of energy for 
a sedentary man.

Diabetes mellitus : A disease in which the blood glucose is increased and the body tissues 
cannot use glucose properly. 

Diverticular disease :  The presence of many pouches or sac-like protrusions on the wall of 
the intestine. 

Empty calories : Term used for foods that provide only energy without any other nutrient, eg. 
white sugar and alcohol. 

Enzymes : Biological catalysts which enhance the rate of chemical reactions in the body. 

Essential fatty acids (EFA) : Fatty acids like linoleic acid and alpha linolenic acid which are 
not made in the human body and must be supplied through the diet. 

Fatty acids : Fundamental constitutents of many lipids.  

Fibre :   Collective term for the structural parts of plant tissues which are resistant to the 
human digestive enzymes. 

Flavonoids : Pigments widely distributed in nature in flowers, fruits and vegetables.

Food Exchange :  Foods are classified into different groups for exchange.  Each “exchange 
list” includes a number of measured foods of similar nutritive value that can be substituted 
inter-changeably in meal plans. 

Free radicals :  Highly reactive oxygen-derived species formed in the body during normal 
metabolic processes.  They have the capacity to damage cellular components by oxidation. 

Haemorrhoids : Commonly known as piles.

124

High-density  lipoproteins  (HDL)  :  These  transport  cholesterol  from  the  extra-hepatic 
tissues to the liver. They are anti-atherogenic. 

Hormones :  Substances produced by a gland (endocrine) which are secreted directly into 
the blood stream to produce a specific effect on another organ. 

Hyperlipidemia  :  An  increase  in  the  concentration  of  blood  lipids  (triglycerides  and 
cholesterol). 

Invisible fats : Fat present as an integral component of plant and animal foods such as in 
cereals, legumes and spices. 

Ischaemia :  Lack of blood supply to an organ or tissue resulting in reduced oxygen supply, 
caused either by constriction or obstruction of the blood vessel. 

Lactoferrin : Minor protein of milk containing iron.

Lactose  intolerance  :  Disorder  resulting  from  improper  digestion  of  milk  sugar  called 
lactose, due to lack of an enzyme, lactase, in the intestinal mucosa. 

Linoleic acid : Fatty acid containing 18 carbon atoms and two double bonds.   The first 
double bond is on the sixth carbon atom from the methyl end.  Therefore it is called n-6 fatty 
acid and is abbreviated as 18:2 n-6. 

Lipids  : A  technical  term  for  fats.    They  are  important  dietary  constituents.  The  group 
includes triglycerides, steroids, cholesterol and other complex lipids. 

Lipoproteins : Lipids are not soluble in blood; they are therefore transported as lipid and 
protein complexes.  

Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) : These transport cholesterol from the liver to tissues.   
High blood levels indicate that more cholesterol is being transported to tissues. 

Macrocytic anaemia : Anaemia characterized by red blood cells which are larger than 
normal.

Macronutrients : Nutrients like carbohydrates, proteins and fats which are required in large 
quantities. 

Metabolism : Includes catabolism and anabolism. 

Microcytic anaemia : Anaemia characterized by red blood cells which are smaller than 
normal. 

125

Micronutrients : Nutrients which are required in small quantities, such as vitamins and trace 
elements. 

Monounsaturated fatty acids : Unsaturated fatty acids with one double bond. 

n-6 PUFA : Linoleic acid and its longer chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are collectively 
called n-6 PUFA.     

n-3  PUFA  :  Alpha-linolenic  acid  and  its  longer-chain  polyunsaturated  fatty  acids  are 
collectively called n-3 PUFA. 

Osteoporosis : A condition of abnormal porousness or thinning of bones. 

Phytochemicals : General name for chemicals present in plants.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) : Unsaturated fatty acids with two or more double 
bonds. 

Processed foods : Foods that are produced by converting raw food materials into a form 
suitable for eating.

Pre-eclampsia: A toxemic condition of late pregnancy characterized by increased blood 
pressure, swelling of feet and excretion of protein in the urine. 

Protein  Energy  Malnutrition  (PEM)  : A  marked  dietary  deficiency  of  both  energy  and 
protein resulting in undernutrition. 

Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) : The amounts of dietary energy and nutrients 
considered sufficient for maintaining good health by the people of a country. 

Refined foods : Foods which have been processed to improve their appearance, colour, 
taste, odour or keeping quality.

Saturated fatty acids :  Fatty acids containing maximum number of hydrogen atoms that 
each carbon atom can carry. They do not have double bonds. 

Satiety : Feeling of satisfaction after food intake.

Stroke : Popular term for cerebro-vascular disease, a sudden condition that arises from 
blocking or bleeding of blood vessels in the brain, resulting in paralysis. 

Thrombosis :  The condition in which the blood changes from a liquid to a semi-solid state 
and produces a blood clot (thrombus) which blocks blood flow. 

126

Trans-fatty acids : Are mainly produced during hydrogenation of oils; a few also occur 
naturally in very small quantities. 

Triglycerides (Neutral fat) :  The major type of dietary fat and the principal form in which 
energy is stored in the body. A complex of fatty acids and glycerol.

Unsaturated fatty acids :  Fatty acids in which there is a shortage of hydrogen atoms.  The 
carbon atoms then become linked by double bonds.  Unsaturated fatty acids are less stable 
than saturated fatty acids. 

Visible fats : Fats and oils that can be used directly or in cooking. 

Weaning foods : Foods which are used during gradual transition of the infant from breast-
feeding to a normal diet.

1.1 Introduction To Indian Food

Indian cuisine consists of a wide variety of regional cuisines native to
India. Due to the range of diversity in soil type, climate and occupations, these
cuisines vary from each other and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables,
and fruits. Indian food is also heavily influenced by religious and cultural choices.

 

2

Hotel Operations

The development of these cuisines has been shaped by Hindu and Jain
beliefs, particularly in vegetarianism which is a common dietary trend in Indian
society. There was also Islamic influence from the years of Mughal and Delhi
Sultanate rule, and Persian interactions on North Indian and Deccan cuisine.
Indian cuisine has been and is still evolving, as a result of the nation’s cultural
interactions with other societies.

Historical incidents such as foreign invasions, trade relations and
colonialism have also played an important role in introducing certain food types
and eating habits to the country. For instance, potato, a staple of North Indian
diet was brought to India by the Portuguese. Indian cuisine has also shaped the
history of international relations whit the spice trade between India and Europe
is often cited by historians as the primary catalyst for Europe’s Age of Discovery.
It has also influenced other cuisines across the world, especially those from
South east Asia and the British Isles.

Fig 1.1 Introduction To Indian Food

Staple foods of Indian cuisine include Jowar, rice, wheat, and a variety
of lentils, especially masoor, toor, urad and moong. Lentils may be used whole,
or split. Split lentils, or dal, are used extensively. Some pulses, such as channa ,
Rajma or kidney beans, lobiya are very common, especially in the northern
regions.

Many Indian dishes of different regions are cooked in different oil
mediums. Peanut oil is used in Andhra and Maharastra regions. Mustard oil is
more commonly used in north and northeastern part of india. Coconut oil is
used widely along the western coast, especially in Kerala. While gingerly oil is
common in the south as it imparts a fragrant nutty aroma to food. In recent
decades, sunflower and soybean oils have become popular across India.
Hydrogenated vegetable oil, known as Vanaspati ghee, is another popular
cooking medium. Desi ghee, is used frequently, though less than in the past.

 1.2  Spices  Used  In  Indian  Cookery

India has been known as the land of spices. In fact had it not been for
the famous ‘spice route’, India would not have been the preferred trade
destination for the Portuguese, British, Persians and other people from all over
the world, and neither would it have been invaded by so countries as well.
Indian cuisine without spices holds little meaning, and no Indian dish is complete
without a smattering of spices. However, each region loves to use specific spices
in its dishes, so much so that no state can manage to replicate what the other
state has to offer to your taste buds. While -South Indian states are known for
their excessive -use of tamarind, Northern states are known for their attachment
to cumin seeds, similarly the eastern part is known for its preference to a mixture
of 4 to 5 spices known as ‘panch poran’, and use of mustard seeds.The list of
spices that will be seen in every masala box

Turmeric or Haldi Powder : Native to tropical South Asia, when mixed
with a little red chilli powder, turmeric adds a distinct flavour and colour to the
dishes. This powder is made from grinding turmeric root. Turmeric is well known
as an antioxidant and cure for cough, cold and even cancer.

Cumin Seeds or Jeera

Native to Syria, cumin seeds are used in all kind of dishes worldwide,
but Indians seem to have a special fondness for it. A majority of Indian dishes
(barring some south Indian dishes) start with a tempering of cumin seeds in
heated oil. Cumin seeds apart from adding flavour to the dishes, also helps in
aiding digestion.

Red Chili Powder or Lal Mirch Powder : A native of the America,
chillis have become so much a part of Indian households, that they are no more
associated with the Latin American countries. Red chili powder holds its spiciness
on the kind of red chili used.

Fig 1.4 Red Chili Powder or Lal Mirch Powder

Mustard Seeds : Ranging from Reddish brown to black in appearance,
this seeds are commonly used in Indian cooking, and even in the preparation of
pickles, and other condiments, and sometimes even as curry. The paste made
from it has a very pungent taste.

Fig 1.5 Mustard Seeds

Paper - I  Food Production - II

Asafetida or Hing: It is the dried gum resin of an east Indian plant. It
should never be eaten raw, as it has a completely pungent taste and odour when
raw. Only when it has been dried over a long period of time, does it become fit
for use in dishes. Usually just a pinch is used for cooking mainly fish, vegetables
and making Indian pickles.

Fig 1.6 Asafetida or Hing

Tamarind : Tamarind is found in bean like structure used mainly to add

a sour taste to many Indian curries.

Dry Mango Powder or Aamchur

Fig 1.7 Tamarind

Fig 1.8 Dry Mango Powder or Aamchur

Hotel Operations

Aamchur powder is another very essential part of the Indian cooking
since it adds a tangy flavor to the dish. It is made after slicing unripe mangoes,
which have been left to dry in the sun for a long period of time, and then ground
into powder. It is also used in chats around India.

Coriander : Coriander is an annual herb that is used very widely in
Indian kitchen. Different parts of the coriander are edible but the fresh leaves
and dried seeds are commonly used in cooking. Chopped coriander leaves are
a garnished for cooked dishes while the dry coriander seeds are used whole or
as ground form. Coriander roots are used in various soups as it has intense
flavour.

Fig 1.9 Coriander

Garlic and Ginger :  A combined paste of ginger and garlic adds a zing
to all kinds of Indian dishes. Garlic and ginger are known for their anti oxidant
properties and also used in various herbal preparations.

Fig 1.10 Garlic and Ginger

Fenugreek Seeds or Methi Seeds : These small, flat, squarish,
brownish-beige seeds are essential in curries, but because they have a slightly
bitter flavor they must be used in the stated quantities. They are especially good

Paper - I  Food Production - II

in fish curries, where the whole seeds are gently filed at the start of cooking; they
are also ground and added to curry powders; The green leaves are used in
Indian cooking and, when spiced, the bitter taste is quite piquant and acceptable.
The plant is easy to grow.

Fig 1.11 Fenugreek Seeds or Methi Seeds

Nutmeg or Jaiphal: It is usually used in its powdered form. Grated
freshly, using the whole or half nutmeg with a very fine grater. Many times it is
used in flavoring Indian sweets. But it may be used in savory dishes as it is used
in the making of some Garam Masalas. It is recommended for insomnia, irritability
and nervousness.

Fig 1.12 Nutmeg or Jaiphal

Sesame Seeds or Til : Sesame seeds are used in many masalas or are
used to flavor the recipe by giving a tadka” with the seeds. It is also used in
some chutney.

Fig 1.13 Sesame Seeds or Til

Fresh Mint Leaves or Pudina : Although there are many varieties,
the common, round-leafed mint or peppermint leaf is the one most often used in
cooking. It  adds flavor  to many  curries, and  mint chutney  is a  favorite
accompaniment to kebabs and a great dipping sauce for snacks.

Curry Leaves or Kaddipatta

Sold dried as well as fresh. They are important in curries. The tree is
native to Asia, the leaves are small and very shiny, and though they keep their
flavor well when dried they are found in such abundance in Asia that they are
generally used fresh. The leaves are fried in oil, until crisp, at the start of preparing
a curry.

Fennel Seeds or Saunf : These light green oval shaped seeds have
been known to posses digestive qualities. In India, they are roasted, sometimes
lightly coated with sugar and eaten after meals as a mouth freshener and to
stimulate digestion. They are also recommended for nursing mothers, as they
have been known to increase the milk supply. Used successfully in many curries
and ‘indian pickles’. Today you will find sugar coated “green supari mixtures
containing ‘saunf” in Indian Grocery stores.

1.4  Basic  Gravies

Indian cuisine revolves around six basic gravies preparing different dishes

commercially they are
1. Makhni gravy

Prepared primarily with tomatoes and without or very less onion. Makhni
gravy is mainly used in the preparation of murg makhni and paneer makhni
where simply the pieces are simmered in the sauce and served .Its generally
used in measured combination of other basic sauces to create some most famous
delicacies like chicken tikka masala
2.  Tomato onion gravy

The gravy is a base to endless dishes like paneer lababdar where the
paneer is simmered in the gravy with extra load of cream to look orange in
colour and otherwise it can always be used in measured combination with other
basic sauces to create ever favourite dishes like chicken do pyaza and aloo dum
masala.

Paper - I  Food Production - II
 

3. Brown gravy

13

This gravy is generally used to make basic curries like chicken curry or
egg curry where the key ingredient is sauteed in oil and further simmered in this
basic sauce till cooked or it can be used in proportional quantities with other
basic sauces to create delicacies like matar paneer. Here primarily brown gravy
and a dash of white gravy gives a required taste of matar paneer.
4. White gravy

This gravy is generally used to prepare rich dishes like shahi paneer
dishes where the paneer cubes are simmered in the sauce else it is also used in
measured combination of other basic sauces to create ever favourite dishes
like qorma and pasanda.
5. Yellow gravy

This is rich gravy with yellowish colour which helps in making a beautiful

product when used alone or in combination of other basic gravy.
6. Kadhai gravy

This is the only gravy which is used alone and not in combination of
other ingredients. The six flovours mentioned above are obtained by sugar,
tomatoes, crushed coriander, ginger, salt and spices.
 
1.5  Famous  Cuisines  Of  India(Concise)

It is true of Indian cooking as it is of the other classic cuisines, that whilst
some of the food is exotic, most of it is simple and just delicious. What
distinguishes Indian cuisine from others is that on the one hand there are elaborate
and rich meat preparations; on the other, there is the exquisite, but simple to
prepare, vegetarian fare. The variety is the envy of the world, as is the range of
tastes; from the sublime mild to the pungent hot. Most important, there is a
delicacy for every occasion, each region boasting of a distinctive style of cooking
to go with its extensive repertoire.
1.5.1 Kashmir Cuisine

Traditional Kashmiri cooking is called Wazawan and comprises mostly
non-vegetarian dishes. It is rich and aromatic with a wonderful unique flavour.
Most Kashmiris including the Brahmins (Kashmiri pandits) are meat-eaters. The
Kashmiri Cuisine is mainly divided between two main communities i.e. Kashmiri
Pandit and Kashmiri Muslims. Kahmiri Pandits are non-vegetarian, but they do
not use onion and garlic in their traditional dishes. An unavoidable ingredient of
Kashmiri Cuisine is curd and Asafetida (hing). Kashmiris use curd in almost all
dishes except certain kebabs. Curd helps to reduce the spiceness, imparts tartness

 

14

Hotel Operations

and also gives smooth creamy consistency. Brahmins and Kashmiri pandits
(Hindus) have generally been great meat-eaters and prefer goat, especially young
goat.

Kashmir has developed its own specialties in cooking. Locally grown
varieties of rice are sweetly fragrant and very light. All the dishes are built around
the main course of rice. The delicious saag is made from a thick-leafed green
leafy vegetable called hak that grows throughout the year. Lotus stem is also an
important produce for boat-dwelling people and makes a very good substitute
for meat. Morel mushrooms called gucchi are harvested and consumed fresh in
summer. They are expensive, therefore used only for specific religions occasions
and wedding feasts. Corn bread is an alternative for rice.

Streams and lakes have influenced the Kashmiri cuisine. Fresh fish is a
favourite. Smoked meat, dried fish and vegetables are stored for use in winter.
A special masala ‘cake’ is made from spice-blends, onions and locally grown
chillies that can be stored for a long period of time and used in flavouring curries.
Sauces are made from dairy-rich products. The fruits and nuts grown from the
valley are used lavishly in the daily menus.
1.5.2 Punjabi Cuisine

Punjab got its name because of five rivers wet this area. It is also known
as the granary of the subcontinent. Wheat and maize are the staple food grains
that the people of Punjab depend on for their nourishment. All lentils, especially
black gram and yellow gram, are a part of Punjabi cuisine. Food of Punjab is
wholesome and very rich in taste and texture. In Punjab, the tandoor is much
more than versatile kitchen equipment. The tandoor is used for cooking roties,
paranthas, naan, kuicha and for cooking non-veg, dishes like tandoori chicken,
tandoori jhinga. The food of Punjab usually has a thick creamy consistency.
They use desi-ghee and white butter in almost all dishes. Milk and milk products
are available in abundance like, paneer, curd, cream etc. As we all know that
Punjab is a land of agriculture and one of the main crops of Punjab is mustard or
sarson and this is used to make the famous dish of Punjab i.e. Makki ki roti and
Sarson ka Saag, roti is prepared with maize flour. Traditionally, meat dishes are
prepared by menfolk, mostly on holidays, with a great deal of flair. The women
are, by and large, vegetarian though they are not averse to cooking meat. Other
holiday favourites include stuffed paratha with yoghurt, lentils (dal or red kidney
beans) with pulao and, occasionally poori aloo.
1.5.3 Mughalai & Awadh Cuisine

Mughlai cuisine is a style of cooking developed in the Indian subcontinent
by the imperial kitchens of the Mughal Empire. It represents the cooking styles

Paper - I  Food Production - II
 

15

used in North India , Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Indian city of Hyderabad.
The cuisine is strongly influenced by the Persian cuisine of Iran, and has in turn
strongly influenced the regional cuisines of Kashmir and the Punjab region. The
taste of Mughlai cuisine vary from extremely mild to spicy, and is often associated
with a distinctive aroma and the taste of ground and whole spices. A Mughlai
course  is  an  elaborate  buffet  of  main course  dishes  with  a  variety  of
accompaniments.

Awadhi cuisine is from the city of Lucknow, which is the capital of the
state of Uttar Pradesh. The cuisine consists of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian
dishes. Awadh has been greatly influenced by Mughal cooking techniques, and
the cuisine of Lucknow bears similarities to those of Persia, Kashmir, Punjab
and Hyderabad; and the city is known for Nawabi foods. The bawarchis and
rakabdars of Awadh gave birth to the dum style of cooking or the art of cooking
over a slow fire, which has become synonymous with Lucknow today. Their
spread consisted of elaborate dishes like kebabs, kormas, biryani, kaliya, nahari-
kulchas, zarda, sheermal, roomali rotis, and warqi parathas. The richness of
Awadh cuisine lies not only in the variety of cuisine but also in the ingredients
used like mutton, paneer, and rich spices including cardamom and saffron.

The richness of Awadhi cuisine lies not only in the variety of cuisine but
also is the ingredients used in creating such a variety. The Chefs of Awadhi
transformed the traditional dastarkhwan with elaborate dishes like kababs,
kormas, kaliya, nahari-kulchas, zarda, sheermal, roomali rotis, and parathas.

Awadhi cuisine has drawn a considerable amount of influence from
Mughal cooking style and bears resemblance to those of Hyderabad and
Kashmir. The cuisine consists of both vegetarian and meat dishes that employ
the dum style of cooking over a slow fire that has become synonymous with
Lucknow.
Difference between Mughal and awadh cuisine

Mughlai food is known for its richness and exotic use of spices, dried
fruit, and nuts. The Mughals did everything in style and splendor. Since they ate
very rich food they reduced the number of intake during the day. Mughlai dishes
as they are called have lots of milk and cream with spices to make rich and spicy
meal that is the reason why Mughlai recipes are rich in fat, carbohydrates and
proteins.

Awadhi food does not use over a hundred spices as some claim, but
use a handful of uncommon spices. The slow-fire cooking lets the juices absorb
into the solid parts. In addition to the major process of cooking food in Awadhi
style, other important processes, such as marinating meats, contribute to the

 

16

taste. This is especially the case with barbecued food that might be cooked in a
clay oven of over an open fire.Fish, red meats, vegetables and cottage cheese
may be marinated in curd and spices. This helps to soften the taste and texture
of them as well as remove any undesired odors from the fleshy materials. They
were often cooked on tawa, the flat iron griddle, as opposed to Mughlai influence
and bear a testimony to the local influence and convenience.

Difference between Awadhi and Mughlai kebabs is that, while the former
is usually cooked on the tawa, the latter is grilled in a tandoor. This is gives the
difference in flavour
1.5.4 Rajasthani Cuisine

Rajasthan is the land of forts, fairs and festivals. In the Royal Kitchens
of Rajasthan the peparation of food was a very serious matter and war raised to
the level of an art form. In Rajasthan a professional Brahamin cook was called
Maharaj. He is the only person who is responsible for whole kitchen and is only
one who is allowed to enter into the kitchen.

Rajasthan cuisine was influenced by its climate, availability of raw material
and also by the life styles of Maharajas, the love for hunting have been responsible
for shaping the culinary art of game cooking, the another part of Rajasthan
cuisine is the vegetarian cooking of the Maheshwaries of Marwar or Jodhpur.
Maheshwaries do not use garlic and onion for their dishes. There are a number
of grains which are grown in Rajasthan-like bajra, makkai, jawar and wheat,
dried lentils and beans are also very popular. Gram flour is used to make gatte
and pakodi. Jewar, Bajra and Makkai are used to make rotis and wheat is used
to make Bati (dal-bati churma). The staple diet of locals is very simple, like
bajre ki roti with lasoon ki chutney as they think that garlic helps to safeguard
against the winds. In Maheswari Cooking, Mango Powder and Asafoetida are
an integral part of cuisine, both ingredients act as a major substitute of tomatoes,
garlic and onions. In Rajasthani cuisine, people use lot of pure ghee is the medium
of cooking, due to the scarcity of water, they use milk or butter milk.
1.4.5 Gujarati Cuisine

Gujarat is a land of all the religions like Jainism, Islam, Buddhism,
Zoroatrianism (Parsees). Population of ujarat are mainly vegetarian, due to the
influence  of  Jams  and  Buddhists  except Parsees  and Bohras  (Muslim
Community). Bohras are very famous for their beef preparations. In Gujarat,
the staple food is millet. Geographically, Gujarat is divided into three main regions
i.e.

•  Kathiawari and Kutch

Paper - I  Food Production - II
 

17

•  Southern Gujarat (Surat)
•  Saurashtra
Kathiawari and Kutch foods are very famous for their spicyness they
use red chilli powder and people of Southern Gujarat also like spicy food but
they prefer green chillies. People from Surat use gur (jaggery) in their cooking
and this gives a sweet tangy flavour to their dishes. Southern part of Gujarat i.e.
Surat has a plenty of green vegetables and fruits and this all is because of proper
rainfall in Southern Gujarat. In Saurashtra, sugarcane, wheat, millet, pulses,
vegetables are available in abudance. The use of jaggery is because of the
abundantly grown sugar-cane. The food of Saurasthra is mainly dominated by
pulses and accompanied by sweets.

For a taste of traditional Gujarati cuisine, one has to try the typical Gujarati
thali that consists of a variety of dat, kadhi, two or three vegetables and pulses,
salad savouries, sweets, pun or chappati, rice, chutneys, pickles and papad.
Farsan or snacks form an essential part of the Gujarati diet. These are prepared
and stored for a time and are then offered to welcome guests. Suratis are also
famous for their vaghar which is the tempering of foods. Vaghar, gives food a
distinctive flavour. Asafoetida is used in all vaghars, as it helps in reducing the
gas in the body.
1.5.6 Maharastrian Cuisine

Like most of the coastal states of India, Marathi food uses lots of fish
and coconut. As in all other parts of India, there is an enormous variety of
vegetables in their regular diet. Grated coconuts spice many kinds of dishes, but
coconut oil is not very widely used as a cooking medium. Peanut and cashew
nut are widely used in vegetables. Peanut oil is the main cooking medium.
Maharashtrians eat both wheat and rice, but rice is given a place of prominence.
It is used in every form imaginable, from steamed rice, flour dumplings (modaks)
served on feast days to the delicate rice flour biscuits (cookies) called anarsa
that served on Diwali.

Ratnagiri, a district of Maharashtra, has the distinction of producing the

best mango in the entire world, called the Apus or Aiphonso.

The Maharashtrian meal is eaten in large metal plates. Most of the food
is already on the plate, neatly laid out in a very special order, all vegetarian. Each
item has its designated place on the plate, like the numbers on a clock. The left
side is for seasonings, relishes and savouries, the right for vegetables, split peas
and sweets.

While the foods of certain Brahmin communities may be classified as
restrained and vegetarian, one has only to look at the extravagance and richness
of the diet of the Marathas headquartered in Kohiapur or the spicy ebullience of
that of the coastal fisherfolk to realise that in meat, even within the state of
Maharashtra, there is a lot of diversity Maharashtra is divided into 5 main regions:
• Vidharbha

 Vidharbha is situated at the North Eastern Part of the Maharashtra.
Vidharbha includes the winter capital—Nagpur and other major cities. In India,
best quality oranges come from Nagpur. In this region, most of the population
likes vegetarian food with mild flavour.
• Kohlapur

Kohlapur is situated at the South Eastern part of the Maharashtra. People
of Kohlapur like spicy food with lots of chillies like Ravan Pithli, Pandra Vassa
etc. Due to the preference of Non Vegetarian, the meat cookery is highly
developed in this region.
• Maratwada

Maratnawaaa is situated at the eastern part, just below the Vidharba,
people of Marathawada like spicy food like Kohlapur. They add lot of chillies
and garlic in their dishes. Marathawada is also popular for its homemade pickles
and chutneys.
• Western Ghats

The Western Chat is situated at the North West Coastline along the
Arabian Sea. The major cities which fall under Western Chat are Mumbai, Nasik,
Pune etc. The people of this region show their preference towards moderately
spiced foods. Fish and other seafood are also very popular. Bombil is a variety
of dried fish which is very popular in this region. We can say that the Western
Chats are birth place of Indian fast foods like Misi, Vada Pao, Pao Bhaji etc.
• Konkan

Konkan is situated at the Southern tip of the Western Coast—Kolhapur
and Ratnagiri are some of the important cities which comes under Konkan.
Ratnagiri is world famous for its Aiphanso Mango. Cookery of this region shows
an influence of Karnataka, as they use lots of coconut in their dishes so coconut
act as an important ingredient. People of this region use kokum (amsul) instead
of tamarind to impart tangy flavour of the dishes. People of Konkan like both
veg. and non veg. dishes.

Paper - I  Food Production - II
 

1.5.7 Goan Cuisine

19

Goan cuisine is a fusion of Christians, Hindus and Portugese Cuisine,
Goan is mainly non-vegetaria. Goa has an over hundred kilometers coastline
along the Arabian Sea, being a coastal region there is Goan who is not familiar
with eating fish and seafoods like prawns, lobster, crabs, pomfrets etc. Goans
prefer rice instead of wheat and they also use coconut milk in plenty, due to the
abundance coconut. Coconut is an essential ingredient of Goan Cuisine.

The other meats which are preferred by Goans are Pork, Lamb and
Chicken. The main features of Goan Cuisine are: they use lot of small red chillies
in their dishes, which make dishes too spicy. Kokum is another important
ingredient, it is sour, deep red colour fruit which imp sharp and sour flavour,
kokum is mainly used by Hindus. Christians prefer vinegar instead of kokun
their dishes. Goans do not have a sweet tooth, but some of the most famous
Goan Sweets are Bibinica and Dod Bibinca is a sweet dish which is made by
Pancakes baked one over another, traditionally it should h 16 layers. These
pancakes are made up of coconut milk, flour, sugar, egg and nutmeg. Dodol is
jaggery flavoured fudge made from palm, jaggery, rice flour and coconut milk.
Fern is an integral part of every Goan, Feni is a locally brewed wine. Goans
make Feni with cashew nut and every Goan enjoy it with their meal.
1.5.8 Hyderabad & Andhra Cuisine

The people of this region are predominantly Muslim and Hindu, therefore
their habits show a clear distinction, although similar in many ways. The
Hyderabadi Muslims got their food habits from the Moghuls while the Hindus
had their own distinctive style, as can be seen from a number of preparations
like Bagare Baigan, Biryani, etc. The cuisine of Andhra Pradesh is reputedly the
spiciest and hottest of all Indian cuisine. The cuisine includes both the original
Andhra cooking and the Hyderabadi cuisine with its Mughlai influence. It is the
former which is red hot. The Hyderabadi Muslim community prefers a liberal
use of red meats and almost all their gravies are made up of rich ingredients.
One of the most characteristic features of the Hyderabadi cuisine is the use of
tamarind as a souring agent, unlike lime used by the Moghuls. Early mornings
begin with Nahari a lambstew made from lamb trotters seasoned with cassia
buds, cardamom and potli ka masala (which includes sandal wood, khas roots
and dried roses). This is eaten with sheermal, a Hyderabadi bread. The richly
flavoured Kacchi Biryani is prepared with tender, marinated lamb and rice cooked
together.

The Andhra food is very spicy because of the abundant cultivation of
chilies in the state. Guntur being the largest producer of chillies in the state, the
Guntur chillies are reputed all over the country for their pungency and colour.

 

20

Hotel Operations

The cuisine is largely vegetarian, with only the coastal areas showing a marked
preference for seafood. Fish and prawn are curried in sesame and coconut oils,
and flavoured with freshly ground pepper and eaten with rice. Traditionally, the
Andhra meal is served on a clean banana leaf or a stainless steel thahi. The
people eat sitting down on the floor or on low wooden stools.

The main course must include rice, dal, vegetables like yam, ladyfinger,
brinjal and bitter gourd. Pulusu and Charu are two thick and thin clear liquids
respectively which are eaten with rice. Like Southern foods, the typical dosa,
etc., can be found in many restaurants, but the favourite remains pesarattu, a
dosa which has the filling of upma and onions. Rasam, fire-hot, is a typical
favourite of the Southern region. Lamb is a great favourite, not to be missed.
The spicy chutneys and pickles of Andhra, especially mango and shrimp, are
simply superb and count among hot favourites. The last course of an Andhra
meal comprises thick set curd which is a must in every Andhra meal. Otherwise
a meal would be incomplete. During the summer season buttermilk or Majjiga is
taken with the meal or as a refreshing drink throughout the day.
1.5.9 Chettinad Cuisine

Rice is the king of grains in this area. No meal is possible without its
making an appearance in one form or the other. Grain and split peas form the
core of the diet. The Chettiyar community, of Chettinad, 250 miles south of
Chennai, have the most interesting chicken dishes, though fish and meat also
form a part of their eating habits. The Chettinad cuisine reflects the lifestyles of
the Nattukotai Chettiars who come from one of the driest regions of South
India, and belong to the most peripatetic of trading communities, merchant
bankers who roamed through the countries of South East Asia, living frugally,
but making enormous fortunes. Their cuisine, on the one hand, is the main branch
of South Indian cuisine that specializes in the preparation of non-vegetarian food,
chicken, meat and fish, all of which have a part to play in a meal and are served
sometimes in a separate thali, hot and darkly pungent with freshly ground masalas
and topped with a boiled egg that is somehow considered essential for a proper
meal. At the same time, there are any number of sun-dried and salted vegetables
that are stored by the Chettiar housewives who make use of every seed, fruit or
legume that grows in the countryside. The Chettinad cuisine is salient spices like
red chillies, pepper, onions and coriander are seasoned to subtle excellence, so
that the vegetable or meat is not overpowered but looks a well-blended flavour
inviting one succulent serving followed by a few others.
1.5.10 Kerala Cuisine

The four distinct groups in the state of Kerala are: the Syrian Christians,
the Muslims called Moflas, the Nairs who are the original warrior class, and

Paper - I  Food Production - II
 

21

finally the Namboodri who are the Brahniins. Yellow banana chips fried in coconut
oil and lightly salted are eaten by all. The rice appam, a pancake also called
vellappam, is common to all Keralites and is eaten with a meat stew by the
Syrian Christian and with aviyal by the Namboodris and Nairs. The idiappam, a
dish of cooked nc noodles, the puttu consisting of rice rawa, grated coconut
and jackfruit cooked with jaggery and cardamom are among the other common
items. The Syrian Christian eats beef. Most of the curries are prepared using
coconut milk.

For Christmas the specialty is wild duck with mappas. Among the
Muslims the use of rice, coconut and jaggery is pronounced. There is also a
strong Arab influence as is seen in their biryani, ground wheat and meat porridge
aleesa. Several flavoured soups are made from both rice and wheat with added
coconut or coconut milk and spices. A distinctive and unusual sweet is muttamala,
chain-like strings of egg yolk cooked in sugar syrup. A wedding feast of the
Nairs includes several types of pachadies, pickels, chips and payasams based
on milk, coconut milk, rice, dal and bananas; however, no meat is served. The
Namboodris who are the Brahmins are strict vegetarians who favour the idli,
dosa and puttu for breakfast with a coconut or curd accompaniment and eat
their rice with koottu, kalan and olan. The use of garlic in their cooking is avoided.
Kerala cuisine is very hot and spicy. Like most places in India, food is
traditionally eaten by hand andserved on a banana leaf. Another interesting feature
is the abundant use of coconut oil, mustard seeds, curry leaves and coconut
milk.
1.5.11 Bengali Cuisine

Bengalis are one of the greatest food lovers in the Indian subcontinent.
Their passion for fish is so that no meal is considered complete without it; A
variety of fish is available in the river Ganges: perch, mullet, crab, carp, prawn,
crayfish, lobster all are loved, bet it is the seasonal hilsa that is priced above all.
For Bengalis the staple food is rice. Though coconut and its oil is available, pure
golden mustard oil is mostly used as a cooking medium. As in all of India, Bengalis
eat everything with their fingers. Whether you have five dishes or sixty, the most
important part of eating in Bengal is having each dish separately with a little rice
in order to savour its individual taste. The more delicate tastes always come
first, graduating to stronger ones. Vegetables, especially the bitter ones, are the
first item, followed by dal, perhaps accompanied by fritters or fries of fish or
vegetable. After this come any of the complex vegetable dishes like ghanto or
chachchari, followed by the important fish jhol as well as other fish preparations.
Meat will always follow fish, and chutneys and ambals will provide the refreshing
touch. Finally comes the dessert.

 Summary

Hotel Operations

Diversity can be found in India’s food as well as its culture, geography
and climate.  Spices are a vital part of food preparation and are used to enhance
the flavor of a dish.  Correct use and blending of the aromatic spices is crucial to
the proper preparation of Indian cuisine.  Even oil is an important part of cooking,
whether it’s mustard oil in the north or coconut oil in the south, each section of
the country has its preferences.

The traditional Indian food culture should not be forgotten by every
generation as it shows the identity of the Indian people itself in terms of culture
and norms. Each of the instruments has its own tales and sentimental values
along with it.

Hotel Operations

From the fourteenth century, sauces were a much appreciated part of
culinary art. Menu was varied which included game, fish, fowl, butcher’s meat.
Vegetables were featured less.

At the end of the sixteenth century, Italian cooks and pastry cooks were
employed. They taught and prepared a number of dishes, which, since then,
remained in the French repertoire, e.g. cannelloni, ravioli, gnocchi (Farinaceous
dishes).

In the seventeenth and eighteenth century, royalty and high ranking people
took great interest in food and the cooks in gratitude named dishes after them.
The cooks during feasts or banquets were honored and appreciated if the food
was good. If something went wrong, they were flogged in front of the guests.
Confectionery, foreign dishes such as caviar, punch, etc. became popular.

French fries have been introduced to this country in the 18th century and
gained so much popularity that they have been kept as part of the traditional
French cuisine. By the early eighteen century, bread and cereals were the basic
ingredients in the daily diet

Only with the beginning of the 19th century food has become a social
etiquette and more sophisticated dishes emerged, mainly served in high societies.
The improvement of transportation, especially the introduction of train, marked
the culinary revolution, since every peasant had access to more elaborated meals,
ingredients and condiments. Vegetables that grow on fertile French lands include
potatoes, green beans, carrots, turnips, aubergines, courgettes, famous French
mushrooms, like champignons, oyster mushrooms, porcinis and truffles. As a
tradition kept along the course of history, wineries

Since the end of the nineteenth century, French culinary art has reached
the highest point of perfection. Chefs like Escoffier and Prosper Salles published
books on cookery, which had far-reaching influence and are known throughout
the world.

The French cooking style is considered to be one of the most refined,
modern and elegant manners found in cuisines all over the world. Food is part of
their culture, and original French recipes made France famous since centuries
ago.
Regional Cuisines of France

The typical France cuisine has techniques and methods common to all
country’s regions, but differences such as the use of butter in the northern parts,
duck fat in the southern ones, and olive oil in the southeast, will give different
flavors to your meals. Also, the eastern parts of France are greatly influenced by

Paper - I  Food Production - II
 

25

the German cuisine, the lard, sausages, beer, and sauerkraut being part of the
regional eating custom.

Auvergne is the place to fine sautés, shallots blue or tomme cheese. The
famous Crêpes highly originate in the Brittany area, where you can also find
Pork dishes and prune flans. Burgundy is well known for Beef or fish stews in
red wine, Gougère, and the escargots (snails baked in shells with parsley butter).
Quiche Lorraine, famous in most european restaurants, originates in the Lorraine
region, together with Potée and Pâté Lorrain. Mediterranean influences in the
French cuisine can best be spotted near Côte d’Azur/Provence.

In the Alsace region, sauerkraut with sausages, salt Pork and potatoes,
spätzle, Baeckeoffe, Bredela and kouglof are just some of the main dishes you
will find in the local cuisine. The Alp region is highly influenced by the Swiss
cuisine, among the main recipes being the raclette (melted cheese served with
potatoes, Ham and often dried Beef), fondue savoyarde, and Tartiflette (a
Savoyard gratin with potatoes, Reblochon cheese and cream. In the Artois-
Picardy region, stews are the main dish available. Fish or Beef is commonly
used in the stews with vegetables, with other types of meat, and sometimes
stewed in beer.
Characteristics of the cuisine

French cooking is less complicated. While cooking, the garnishes served
are more complex. It has a delicate flavour, as spices are used sparingly to just
tease the palate. Sauce cookery plays an important role in French cuisine.  Every
ingredient speaks its own language. Wines used for cooking enhance the taste
as it gives an unusual flavour, which emphasis the unique feature of French cuisine.
The most important rule is to use only the best ingredients and the proper blend
of colour and taste of ingredients.

Garnishes and accompaniments play a key role in French cuisine and
dishes are identified by them. Food items are cooked in sauces or they
accompany a dish, e.g. roast beef is served with Yorkshire pudding and is
accompanied with horseradish sauce. Presentation of the dishes is most important
I French cuisine. Garnishes and accompaniments make the dish colourful.

Ingredients play an important role as it has climatic variations in the
south of France; the Mediterranean heat adds flavour and richness to fruits,
vegetables and herbs. In the northern region, finest fish is available. In certain
regions, mushrooms and hard cheese are popular. The wines for cooking come
from Bordeaux, Champagne and Brittany.

The cooking medium used is butter, olive oil or salad oil, thus the dishes
are not greasy, but give a lightness to the taste. Spices and herbs give a subtle

 

26

Hotel Operations

flavour, taste and originality to the dishes. Some of the spices and herbs are
parsley, celery, basil, tarragon, thyme, rosemary, chives, shallots, allspice, bay
leaf, paprika, pepper, nutmeg, etc. Popular continental vegetables are asparagus,
artichokes, carrots, turnips, aubergines, broccoli, seakale, cardoon, Brussels
sprouts, mushroom, etc.

 Vegetables are served with main courses and served as one of the
accompaniments and they add colour to the menu. A meal is completed with
potatoes as they give a satiety value and also accompany the main dish. The
main dish consists of flesh foods such as lamb, beef, veal, pork, chicken, duck,
turkey, fish, etc. and the fleshy foods should be of the best quality.

Cheese is extensively used and can be used as a base of dish, or to
garnish and blend with soups. It is also sprinkled on top of the dishes after being
grated. Cheese in a French menu forms a separate course during the meals and
is called “Fromage” in French. Almost every region of France has its own
cheese and a few popular cheeses are Camembert, Neufchatel, Roquefort, Brie,
etc.

Red and white wines are used for cooking. Wine is much more than just
a flavouring agent, if used with discretion. It gives an unmistakable fillip to the
simplest dishes, ragouts, and in marinades. It acts as tendenzers for the drier
and tougher cuts of meat.  Sauces have the quality of giving contrast or blend
with the ingredients, enhance taste, flavour and give colour to the dishes.
Equipment for French Cooking

When you plan on cooking in a French manner, you will be in need of a
lot of pots and serving spoons, spatulas, forks, turners, scrapers and tongs.
Food processors, mixers, grinders and splatters are of great utility in this cuisine,
especially for grating hard condiments like black pepper or cinnamon over an
already prepared meal placed in a dish. The aspect of a meal is one of the most
important things to consider, and you must have all the necessary equipment to
arrange every single element in the ornamental dish.

Deep serving dishes are required for the traditional French Onion soups.
Cover lids and insulated food carriers are used to keep the temperature of the
food constant. Food thermometer in common tool in French kitchen, as the
stews and the soups get cold fast, and serving at right temperature is very important
in French cuisine. 
 
2.3  Nouvelle  cuisine

In the early 70s chefs wanted to bring about a change in French cuisine.
It was done by H. Gault and C. Millan, as they were tired of eating the same
classical food every day. It revolutionized French cookery.

Paper - I  Food Production - II
 

27

Revolution is started by emphasizing on serving original salads, vegetable
terrines, fish just cooked on the bone. It took about 20 years for people to take
to nouvelle cuisine dishes. It was easier to get the recognition and now many
restaurants are not offering the French classical dishes.

The nouvelle cuisine was influenced greatly by the monthly publication
by Gault and Millan. They increased from 10,000 copies to 20 lakh copies per
month. The change from the classical cuisine was brought about by.
The following points

•  A variety of dishes were served on the menu but smaller portions
   were served.
•  Presentation of the food was given a lot of importance by serving it on
   a plate, so that the presentation was not spoilt by the service
   personnel. Individual portions were placed on the plate and served.
•  The sauces were served thinner; flour was not added for thickening.
•  The cooking time was reduced by stir-frying, frying, grilling, etc.
•  Fresh foodstuffs had to be used and emphasis was laid on seasonal
   vegetables, fishes, etc. The items should be bought from the best
   suppliers.
•  Unusual flavours, combinations were prepared. The dishes like spit
    roasted chicken and items like veal chops, steaks, fish are cooked in
   its own juices.
•  Selection of prime fresh products and elaboration of audacious taste
    combinations with amplified decoration.
The dishes were influenced by Chinese cuisine by preparing dishes with
plenty of good-quality crisp vegetables, tender meat items and cooking by stir-
frying and steaming. To give a different taste, some Indian spices such as ginger,
coriander, cumin and saffron were used.

The latest equipment such as microwave ovens, high-pressure steamers,
vacuum cooking and infrared grillers are used. The nouvelle cuisine has created
interest but it has not got the same popularity as French classical cuisine; in
India, only few restaurants are serving nouvelle cuisine. Abroad, some of the
Indian restaurants are offering nouvelle Indian cuisine, less spicy and less greasy,
etc.

 2.4 Italian  cuisine

Italian cuisine as a national cuisine known today has evolved through
centuries of social and political change. Its roots can be traced back to the 4th
century BC. The cuisine changed significantly with discovery of the New World
which helped shape much of what is known as Italian cuisine today with the
introduction of items such as potatoes, tomatoes, bell pepper and maize, which
are all central parts of the cuisine but were not introduced in scale until the 18th
century.

Ingredients and dishes vary by region. There are many significant regional
dishes that have become both national and regional. Many dishes that were
once regional, however, have proliferated in different variations across the country
in the present day. Cheese and wine are also a major part of the cuisine, playing
different roles both regionally and nationally with their many variations. Coffee,
and more specifically espresso, has become highly important to the cultural cuisine
of Italy.

When contemplating the history of Italian cuisine, it is important to
remember that Italy did not exist as a unified country before 1870. Prior to that,
it was a diverse collection of kingdoms and principalities.

Similarly, one needs to remember that most recipes in the Italian
repertoire have come down to us from generations of poor, hard-working people.
While the feasts provided by the Medici, Estes and Lombardi are the stuff of
legend, court fare was more closely identified with French and Austrian cuisine
and subject to changes in fashion and taste. This has little to do with what we
now identify as Italian cooking, which was largely dependent on locally and
seasonally available products and which probably evolved very slowly over the
centuries.

Several major changes have nonetheless shaped Italian cooking, notably
the acceptance of tomatoes as a food in the 18th century. To a lesser extent and
at about the same time, potatoes became a regular part of several regional
cuisines.
Regional Cuisines of Italy

The Italian cuisine is characterized by some specific unique dishes, like
pasta, risotto and pizza, which are served in all parts of the country. However,
regional differences may occur in the cooking process of a meal, resulting in
variations of the same recipe, or unique specific ones of a single area, like the
Napoli pizza, specific to the Neapolitan region.

In the Tuscan region, hearty soups and fish stews are common thing.

Cacciucco and scottiglia are some of the specific Tuscan stews.

Lombardy is well known for Milan related dishes, such as spaghetti
Milanese and minestrone alla Milanese, and for other specialties such as creamy
Gorgonzola and polenta. Rice and peas are specific for the Veneto region, where
you can also find calf’s liver fried with onions, shellfish, eels and dried Cod.

In Genoa region pesto is the main ingredient, and in Norcia, the Italian
cuisine capital, you can find pork dishes, black truffles, and hand-made pasta
like “strozzapreti.” Sicily is rich in fruits and seafood, as well as Sardinia, which
is also known for sausages, sweet green olives, and Lamb steaks.
Equipment for Italian Cooking

Italian cooking requires a lot of pots and serving spoons, spatulas, forks,
turners, scrapers and tongs. Big pots that can be placed over open fires are
specific to this cuisine. baking pots and dishes are very popular in the Italian
cuisine, as lot of meals are prepared in the oven rather than on an electric fire.
The famous pizza specialties are only baked in ceramic or clay ovens to give the
crispy taste to the dough.

Wooden spatulas are frequently used in the cooking process, not only
for stirring, but for pizza-grabbing and handling. Food processors, mixers, grinders
and splatters are of great utility in this cuisine, especially in the Sausage making
process, and for grating hard condiments like black pepper or cinnamon. Deep
serving dishes are required for the traditional Italian pasta, for soups and for
stews.
 
2.5  Oriental  cuisine
Oriental Cuisine

Oriental cuisine can actually refer to very different styles of Asian cooking
depending on the nation or area. The Oriental section of Asia covers a huge
chunk of eastern Asia known as the Far East and their wide range of culinary
traditions. Oriental cooking may be different from one nation to another nation.
Geography

The geography of the area that makes up “the Orient” stretches from
east Siberia south all the way to Indonesia and includes Mongolia, Japan, Korea,
Vietnam, Thailand and most of China. Oriental cuisine almost always refers to
some type of Asian cooking from the Far East region eliminating most dishes
from Siberia and Indonesia.

Chinese Cuisine

Hotel Operations

There are many types of Chinese cuisine, because different areas of
China can have distinctly different styles of cooking. Many times when someone
in Europe or America thinks of Oriental food, Chinese food comes to mind,
with its use of chicken, rice, Vegetables, sauces and exotic ingredients.
Japanese Cuisine

Japanese cuisine is a type of Oriental cuisine. Japanese culinary tradition
makes heavy use of fish along with sushi and other seafood. This cooking has a
very distinct taste and style compared to many other types of Asian cooking
from the Far East area, because there is less frying and more careful preparation
of steamed or even raw foods.
Korean Cuisine

Korean cuisine is another form of Asian cooking that can fall under the
umbrella term of Oriental cuisine. Kimchi involves putting rotting vegetables in a
stew and burying the stew pot to make it ferment. Rice, noodles, seaweed and
snails are also used in Korean cuisine, and Koreans’ spicy barbecue is beginning
to catch on.
South East Asian cuisines

Cuisine from Southeast Asia also qualifies as Oriental food, with Thai
and Vietnamese being the two that are most well known in Western nations.
Various noodles, curries and hot spices help distinguish Southeast Asian cooking
from that of some of the other Oriental nations that make up the Far East.

While Oriental cuisine is a broad term that can cover man styles of
cooking. In china, Oriental cuisine might mean Korean or Japanese food, while
in Vietnam it might mean Chinese or Japanese food, and in Japan it could mean
Thai or Mongolian. From that standpoint, what exactly Counts as “Oriental” in
Asia varies by country.
The Three Oriental Cuisine Areas

1. The South West - India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Burma
2. The North East - China, Korea, Japan
3. The South East - Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia,
    Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei.
Curries are very important to the cuisines of the South East and South
West, and less in the cuisine of the North East. South Western curries are
generally based on yogurt, whereas the curries of the South East and North
East are generally based on coconut milk.

Paper - I  Food Production - II
 

31

Rice is a staple starch in all three cuisines areas. In addition to rice,
South Western cuisines include a variety of leavened and unleavened breads
and South East and North East cuisines include rice and egg noodles.

In the South West, the major oil used in frying is ghee, or clarified butter.
In the South East and North East, the major oils are vegetable oils. Garlic and
ginger are used in all three cuisine areas, and chillies are common the South
West and South East. The North Eastern cuisines use soy sauce in nearly
everything; the South East substitutes fish sauce; there is no equivalent in South
Western cooking. In the South East, there are two additional flavorings that are
not used in the other cuisines - galangal and lemon grass.
Special Equipment to Cook Oriental Cuisine

•  The Wok : The wok is the most important piece of cooking equipment
in Southeast Asia and China. The different type of woks available are - round-
bottomed and flat-bottomed, on- handled and two- handled, mild steel, stainless
steel, aluminum, and Teflon coated. The most traditional is hand beaten of mild
steel with a round bottom and two handles. A new wok must be seasoned
before use. Scrub it well with soap and water to remove any coating applied to
protect it during shipping, rinse well, and dry. Place the wok over low heat,
wipe lightly with vegetable oil and let stand on the heat for 10 minutes. Cool and
wipe with paper towels to remove the dark film. Repeat the oiling, heating,
cooling and wiping procedure until the paper towels come away clean. Once a
wok has been seasoned, it should be cleaned with plain water only using a wok
brush,

•  Wok Tools : The most important wok tool is the long handled shovel-
shaved scoop used to stir fry. Other wok tools include; a ladle, used to transfer
liquids to and from the wok; a strainer with a brass or steel basket to remove
foods from hot oil. A strainer with a bamboo basket for removing foods from
boiling water or stock; a bamboo whisk brush for cleaning; a rack which sits on
the side of the wok for draining fried foods.

•  Steamers : Large dedicated steamers with multiple stacking are
available in stainless steel or aluminum, but more common are the stackable
bamboo steamers. These are designed to be used in a wok over boiling water,
and are often used as serving dishes.

•  Clay Pots are glazed :  Inside but unglazed on the outside are used
for baking or stewing. They are available in a range of sizes, and like woks, with
either one handle or two.

•  Cleavers : The oriental cleaver is a very versatile instrument - it
performs all the functions of the various knives of western kitchens. Light cleavers

 

32

Hotel Operations

are used for general chopping, slicing and carving; heavier, thicker cleavers are
used for chopping bones. A good set of kitchen knives can be substituted.

•  Rice Cooker  : If you are cooking rice often, a rice cooker is worth
the investment. Place rice and water in the cooker, plug it in and press the
button. Perfect rice very time.

•  Hand Held : Blender or Small Food Processor Most South East
Asian dishes require considerable fine chopping - a hand held blender with a
mincer /chopper attachment or a small food processor will cut your preparation
time in half.
Conclution

International cuisine is largely an invention of the multinational hotel chains.
It is an assembly of dishes largely drawn from the classic French and Italian,
oriental cuisines in many cases toned down a little in flavour so as to give no
offence to the client. The cuisines are formed unique and to be understood in
their own way. The simplest way to understand the cuisines is to understand the
culture, lifestyles and eating habits.

3.1 Introduction of Food laws

In order to meet a country’s sanitary requirements, food must comply
with the local laws and regulations to gain market access. These laws ensure the
safety and suitability of food for consumers. Each country regulates food differently
and has its own food regulatory framework.

 

34

 3.2 Food  Laws

Hotel Operations

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has been
established under Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 which consolidates
various acts & orders that have handled food related issues in various Ministries
and Departments till now. FSSAI has been created for laying down science
based standards for articles of food and to regulate their manufacture, storage,
distribution, sale and import to ensure availability of safe and wholesome food
for human consumption. This act overrides all other food related laws. It will
specifically repeal eight laws.
1. The Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954

A basic statute protects India against impure, unsafe, and fraudulently
labeled foods. The PFA standards and regulations apply equally to domestic
and imported products and cover various aspects of food processing and
distribution. These include food colour, preservatives, pesticide residues,
packaging and labeling, and regulation of sales.

Fig 3.1 Department of Prevention of Food Adultration, New Delhi

2. The Fruit Products Order, 1955

The fruit and vegetable processing sector is regulated by the Fruit
Products Order, 1955 (FPO), which is administered by the Department of Food
Processing Industries. The FPO contains specifications and quality control
requirements regarding the production and marketing of processed fruits and
vegetables, sweetened aerated water, vinegar, and synthetic syrups. All such
processing units are required to obtain a license under the FPO, and periodic
inspections are carried out. Processed fruit and vegetable products imported
into the country must meet the FPO standards.

5. The Edible Oils Packaging (Regulation) Order, 1998

According to this order, from the 15th day of December, 1998, there is
prohibition of sale, expose for sale, distribute, offer for sale, dispatch, deliver to
any person for the purpose of sale of any edible oil if it is not satisfying following
norms.

•  Conforming to the standards of quality as provided in the Prevention
    of Food Adulteration Act,1954 (37 of 1954) and rules made there

7. The Milk and Milk Products Order, 1992

The production, distribution and supply of milk products is controlled
by the Milk and Milk Products Order, 1992. The order sets sanitary requirements
for dairies, machinery, and premises, and includes quality control, certification,
packing, marking and labeling standards for milk and milk products.

Fig 3.6 Milk Packing Plant

8. Essential Commodities Act, 1955 relating to food

The main objective of the Act is to regulate the manufacture, commerce,
and distribution of essential commodities, including food. A number of Control
Orders have been promulgated under the provisions of this Act.

Voluntary Standards

Hotel Operations

There are two organizations that deal with voluntary standardization
and certification systems in the food sector. The Bureau of Indian Standards
looks after standardization of processed foods and standardization of raw
agricultural produce is under the purview of the Directorate of Marketing and
Inspection.
Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)

The activities of  BIS are two fold the formulation of Indian standards in
the processed foods sector and the implementation of standards through
promotion and through voluntary and third party certification systems. BIS has
on record, standards for most of processed foods. In general, these standards
cover raw materials permitted and their quality parameters; hygienic conditions
under which products are manufactured and packaging and labeling requirements.
Manufacturers complying with standards laid down by the BIS can obtain and
“ISI” mark that can be exhibited on product packages. BIS has identified certain
items like food colours/additives, vanaspati, and containers for packing, milk
powder and condensed milk, for compulsory certification.

Fig 3.8 Bureau of Indian Standards
Directorate of Marketing and Inspection (DMI)

The DMI enforces the Agricultural Products (Grading and Marketing)
Act, 1937. Under this Act, Grade Standards are prescribed for agricultural and
allied commodities. These are known as “Agmark” Standards. Grading under
the provisions of this Act is voluntary. Manufacturers who comply with standard
laid down by DMI are allowed to use “Agmark” labels on their products.

3.3 Food additives
 

As this is the generation of convenience and processed foods, the food
produced on the large scale that is needed to supply supermarkets and other
food shops has to be transported and stored before it is consumed. It has to
stay in top condition over a much longer period of time than home-cooked
food. In order to keep up in good quality food additives place an important role.
In some products, they are so essential that additives are used even in certain
organic foods. Preservatives, colours and flavours are the best known additives
but in fact there are many categories of additives, each tailored to a specific
purpose.

Food additives have been used by mankind for centuries. Salt, sugar
and vinegar were among the first and used to preserve foods. In the past 30
years, however, with the advent of processed foods, there has been a massive
explosion in the chemical adulteration of foods with additives.
Few additives commonly used are
Colours

There are three types of colours. They are natural colours, nature Identical
Colours, synthetic colours. Natural colours are obtained from natural sources
such as grasses,  leafy vegetables, fruit skins, roots and  seeds of plants.
Nature Identical colours obtained from natural sources can be costly and their
quality can vary. Indigoid, found in beetroot, carotenoids, found in carrots,
Synthetic Colours are colours that do not occur in nature and have been made
in a factory. They have been carefully tested to make sure that they are safe. The
main examples of synthetic colours are azo dyes etc.

 

40

Flavors

Hotel Operations

Flavourings are used in a wide range of food products. Most flavourings
are an imitation of the flavour of a known foodstuff. Some flavours are isolated
from natural raw ingredients but this is costly and also wastes valuable natural
resources
Food Preservatives

Most preservatives today are actually fungi static in their action. That
means they prevent the growth of fungi, moulds and yeasts. They have little
effect on bacteria but using a combination of preservatives, with antibacterial
properties; can give good all round protection. Food preservatives help to control
the spread of bacteria which can cause life threatening illnesses.
Anti-caking agents

Anti-caking agents are added to allow them to flow and mix evenly
during the food production process. They rarely have nutritional value and only
a small proportion of the additives find their way into the food.
Antioxidants

Antioxidants are added to food to slow the rate of oxidation and, if
used properly, they can extend the shelf life of the food in which they have been
used.
 
3.4  Food  Adulteration

Food adulteration has become a very common practice in our country.
These foods are consumed every day, which leads to numerous harmful effects
to our health. Food adulteration means anything adding or subtracting with food
making it injurious to health. This adulteration may be done intentionally or
unintentionally. Intentional adulteration is a criminal act and punishable offense.
Under the Prevention of Food Adulterant Act, A substance added to a
food-item to reduce its quality in order to increase its quantity is called as an
adulterant. This act of addition of the adulterant in food-items is known as food
adulteration. The addition of adulterant may be intentional or accidental. The
major reason for the intentional addition of these adulterants is for increasing the
profit margin on the expense of the health of the public or consumer. These days
rarely any food item is spared from the malicious practice of food adulteration.
Almost every food-item from milk to fruits, from vegetables to grains is
added with adulterants. Some adulterants enter via agricultural steps, as they
are not cleaned well. These are visible adulterants like stones, leaves, soil, sand
and dust to name a few. The consumer can clean them and this makes it less

Paper - I  Food Production - II
 

41

harmful. Other adulterants that are intentionally added are invisible or they are
made invisible by astutely camouflaging with the color or texture. They are
generally harmful for the health and most of them lead to serious health problems
like cancer. Adulterant reduces the quality of the food and this weakens the
health of the one who consumes them, thereby increasing the cost for healthcare.
Regular intake of an adulterated food can lead to many health problems.
From curable to incurable disorders and diseases can ruin one’s lifestyle and life
as well.
Food is considered as adultred

•  When any inferior or cheaper substance has been substituted

                wholly or in part.

• Any constituent of the article has been wholly or in part abstracted
• The article has been prepared, packed or kept under insanitary
   conditions.
•  The article consists in part filthy, rotten, decomposed or diseased
    animal or vegetable or is infested with insects
• The article is obtained from diseased animal
• The article contains any poisonous ingredient
• The article has a colour which is not prescribed or in excess then
   prescribed limits
• The article contains any prohibited or excessive preservatives.
• The quality nor purity of the article falls below prescribed standard

Food Adulteration occurs in rural as well as urban areas. So the first
option is to buy Agmark and ISI-marked products. If any person manufactures
for sale, stores, sells imports or distributes any article of food which is adulterated
or misbranded, he is liable under the PFA Act to be punished with imprisonment
and fined.  If adulated food is identified, then it is the responsibility of the consumer
to Complain the same to Prevention of Food Adulteration Department in your
nearest area and report to the newspapers and make more and more people
aware to take joint action.
 
3.5 Causes  of food  spoilage

Food spoilage is considered as undesirable changes occur in food due
to the influence of air, heat, light, moisture, which foster the growth of
microorganisms. Foods take different period of time to lose their natural form
though spoilage. In context to food preservation, foods are classified as.

 

44

Hotel Operations

•  Perishable-meat, fish, milk fruits and some vegetable,
•  Semi perishable-eggs, onions, potatoes, carrot, beans and
•  Non-perishable-cereals, pulse nuts.

Foods are spoilt by the action

1. Micro-organisms
2. Enzymes and
3. Insects.
1. Micro-organisms : The micro-organisms responsible for food
    spoilage are moulds, yeast and bacteria.
Moulds : Moulds are in the form of threads developed on perishable
foods and are easily visible to the eye. They contain spores which can spread
through the air and start new mould plants. When these moulds find a favorable
environment, they germinate and produce a fluffy growth, often white or grey
but sometimes bluish-green, red, orange or some other colour, depending upon
the variety of the mould. Most moulds are not harmful.

Yeasts : Yeasts are tiny organisms which are not visible to the naked
eye, but which can be seen through the microscope. They multiply very fast and
cause fermentation by acting on certain components of the perishable foods like
fruit juices, syrups etc. During yeast fermentation, the sugars present in the food
are broken up to form alcohol and carbon dioxide. Foods liable to be spoiled
by yeasts are fruit juices, syrups, molasses, honey, jams and jellies.

Bacteria : Bacteria are unicellular organism and are much smaller in
size than either yeasts or moulds. They occur in different sizes and shapes and
are classified as coccus (spheroidal), bacilli (cylindrical) or spirillae (spirillar) on
the basis of their shape as seen under the microscope. They also vary in their
requirement for food, moisture, acidity, temperature and oxygen. Bacteria can
grow and develop rapidly between 20°C and 53°C.

2. Spoilage by Enzymes : Enzymes are organic catalyst present in
living cells. The life of every living cell depends upon the chemical reactions
activated by these enzymes. Hence, they cause food spoilage due to the chemical
reactions as in cutting apples; it becomes brown while tomato cause develops a
black scum. Enzymes are sensitive to heat and are easily destroyed by heat.
They can act from 0°C to 60°C; their optimum temperature of reaction is usually
37°C. All enzymes are inactivated by temperatures above 80°C. Therefore,
enzyme activity can be prevented by heating foods to temperature which
inactivate the enzymes. It can also be prevented by cooling (as in freezing and

Paper - I  Food Production - II
 

45

refrigeration) by elimination of air, by protection from light and by addition of
anti-oxidants.

3. Spoilage by insects : Worms, bugs, weevils, fruit flies, moths cause
extensive damage to food and reduce its nutritional value and make it unfit for
human consumption.
Prevention of food spoilage

To prevent from spoiling, handle and store food properly. fresh and
perishable food like fish, meat and poultry should be stored in freezer compartment
in the freezer compartment of the refrigerator. Cooked food, eggs and dairies
should be stored in the lower compartment of the freezer in the refrigerator
between 2C to 8C, and fruits and vegetables should be stored in the vegetable
crisper of the refrigerator. Drying foods like dried fish, dried fruits and vegetable
as bacteria do not thrive on dried foods should be stored in air tight containers.
Food can be further preserved by killing the microorganism through heating or
cooking, by adding salt, vinegar, or sugar in the food. Food stored in presence
of insects, rodents, bacteria, and foreign matters that may cause damage to the
food.
 
3.6 Common food & water borne diseases and their
      prevention

Food may be contaminated through unclean utensils and equipment.
The pathogenic organisms eliminated from the human body are found in sewage.
If untreated sewage is allowed to drain into any drinking water, the water as well
as fish breeding in such Waters gets contaminated. Salad vegetables, roots and
tubers are at a greater risk of contamination as they are consumed raw and
because they are in direct contact with the soil. Rats, flies and cockroaches can
also transmit disease.

They live in sewers and garbage dumps. Unpasteurized milk and meat
from diseased animals can transfer pathogens of animal origin. The spread of
communicable diseases can be controlled and these diseases are discussed in
detail later on in this chapter.
3.6.1 Common food borne diseases

A food-borne illness is a general term applied to all types of illnesses
caused by an organism, substance or material of any kind which is present in
food and gains entrance into the body when such food is consumed. The cause
of contamination is generally faulty handling, poor sanitary practices, insects,
rodents or micro-organisms. The natural decay that occurs in animal or plant
tissues is accompanied by foul odours> and changes in appearance and taste.

 

46

Hotel Operations

 As the spoilage is visible, people reject the food. The main cause for
concern is food which is spoilt but where spoilage is not visibly noticeable. Such
food is likely to be consumed and may result in disease.
Food may transmit disease by any of the following ways

1.  The food itself may be wholesome but may act as a vehicle of disease
transmission. Pathogenic organisms can be transmitted from one person to another
through many routes like soiled linen, unclean cups, handkerchiefs, door handles
etc. Food handled with soiled hands or on which an ill person or a carrier has
coughed or sneezed, can also cause illness. Diseases like tuberculosis, tonsillitis,
typhoid and influenza can be easily transmitted this way.

2.  The food may serve as an ideal medium for rapid growth and
multiplication of a large number of micro-organisms like Staphylococci and
Salmonella. This may result in food poisoning or food infection. These micro-
organisms can cause violent illness of the stomach and intestinal tract. Some of
these bacteria release toxins into the food. The bacteria may die but the toxins
formed cause food poisoning. Other bacteria do not act until they are consumed
along with food. They then cause an infection of the gastro-intestinal tract.

3.  Food poisoning may be caused by agents other than micro-organisms.
These include toxic chemicals, poisonous plants like poisonous mushrooms,
insecticides and pesticides. Toxic metals such as cadmium, zine, lead etc., or
excessive use of mono-sodium-glutamate in Chinese food may lead to severe
reactions. Some individuals may show abnormal sensitivity to certain foods and
develop  allergies.  Common  food  allergens  are egg  white, shellfish  and
strawberries.

Food-borne hazards may thus result from microbial action, toxic metals
and pesticides, animal parasites, natural poisonsin foods or allergic reactions of
a person due to sensitivity to a particular food of all he food-borne hazards
listed above, diseases caused by microbial action in food are widespread. Micro-
organisms cause food poisoning and food infection and animal parasites cause
infestation. All these can be controlled by hygienic handling of food and good
personal hygiene. Micro-organisms which cause food-borne illnesses are bacteria,
viruses, protozoans and nematodes.

Among all these micro-organisms, bacterial contamination is the most
common cause of food poisoning in the catering industry. It usually results from
mishandling of food. These illnesses are characterised by a severe disturbance
of the stomach and intestines which occurs after consuming food in which the
offending bacteria were given a chance to multiply. Such illness is broadly divided
into two categories: food poisonings and food infections.

Difference between Food Poisoning and Infection

Food Poisoning

Food Infection

• Caused by toxin
• Incubation period : Two hours
• Symptoms : Nausea and vomiting
  diarrhoea, usually no fever
• Duration : One day, sometimes
• longer

• Caused by living micro-organisms
• Incubation period : 12-24 hours
• Symptoms : Diarrhoea,
  abdominal pain, vomiting, fever
• Duration : One to seven days
• Sometimes longer

Prevention of food borne illness

•  Wash all fruits and vegetables thoroughly before serving.
•  Make sure all chopping and cooking surfaces are clean and disinfected
   beforehand.
•  Wash your hands frequently.
•  Cook meat thoroughly on high heat.
•  Don’t cross-contaminate food.
•  Follow preparation of raw meat with a thorough cleaning. Wash
   anything that came in contact with the meat or meat juice with

               antibacterial cleanser.
3.6.2 Common water born diseases
Water-borne diseases

Water related diseases are the most common cause of deaths. Around
1.5 million children in India are estimated to die of diarrhoea alone. The scarcity
of clean water for domestic use has led to the increase in the number of deaths
in both the urban and rural areas. Deaths due to water related diseases in India
are in the range of nearly 80 percent. Here is a list of the 5 most deadly water
related diseases that occur in common.
 i. Diarrhoea

• Diarrhoea remains the most prevalent water related disease as it mostly
affects children under the age of 5 and often leads to death. Diarrhoeal infection
is spread through food and drinking water that has been contaminated. A

 

48

Hotel Operations

diarrhoeal attack can last up to 2 weeks and leave the person completely
dehydrated.

•  Symptoms of diarrhoea include, severe dizziness, loss of consciousness,
   dehydration and pale skin, little or no urination and in some case
   bloody stool.
•  Diarrhoea can spread through multiple viruses that is found in
    contaminated water. The poorer sections of the society come in daily
   contact with this water and that is the why the rate of diarrhoea is
   highest amongst them.

ii. Cholera

•  Thousands of people fall prey to cholera every year. Cholera is a
    water related disease, and is diarrhoeal in nature. It can kill in hours
    if left unattended. Cholera strikes when one ingests water that is
    infested with the Vibrio Cholerae bacterium.
•  Symptoms of cholera include watery bowels and fever in certain
   cases. Cholera can happen to both children and adults.
•  In India cholera related deaths are most common in places with shortage
   of good quality water.

iii. Malaria

•  Malaria or Malarial fever is spread by the Plasmodium parasite
   mosquito that breeds in water bodies like lakes and paddy fish.
    Stagnant water is another favourite breeding ground for these deadly
   parasites. Malaria mostly kills children, as adults slowly form some
   sort of immunity against the parasite, over the years.
•  Malarial fever symptoms include fevers, chills, headaches and vomiting.
    Sometimes these symptoms are also coupled with anaemia.  A malarial
   infection shows only after a week has passed. Therefore, treating it
   immediately is a necessity.

iv. Japanese Encephalitis

•  Japanese encephalitis is a water related disease that is caused by the
    Culex Tritaeniorhynchus and Culex Vishnui type of mosquitoes. These
    mosquitoes’ favourite breeding ground is water flooded paddy fields.
   Therefore, Japanese encephalitis is majorly found in the agricultural
   regions of India.

Paper - I  Food Production - II
 

49

•  The Japanese encephalitis virus attacks children the most and in some
    cases this water related disease can lead to death. The symptoms of
    Japanese encephalitis include fever, vomiting, headaches and in acute
   cases, coma, seizures and finally death.

v. Filariasis

•  Filariasis is a parasitic disease and affects people who live near
     unsanitary water bodies or sewages. Filariasis is spread by mosquitoes
    that breeds in fresh and stagnant water bodies and is the host of the
    filarial nematode worm. This worm affects humans and leads to
    elephantitis.
•  Filariasis can lead to blindness, and rapid skin pigmentation and the
   filarial worms can affects various parts of the body. Filariasis is a
   concern for the rural population in India whose major occupation is
   agriculture.
•  Although Filariasis can be treated and prevented with oral medicines,
  lack of medicines in rural India leads to severe disfiguration in many
  cases.

Learning  Objectives
After studying this unit, the student will be able to

• Know about pastry items
• Know about different icings and pastry creams

 
4.1  Introduction

The mixture of fat flour,salt and water is known as pastry. Optional
ingredients like sugar, flavour, milk solids may be added. The method of mixing
is differ for different pastries.
 
4.2  Pastry

Pastry is the name given to various kinds of baked products made from
ingredients such as flour, sugar, milk, butter, shortening, baking powder, and/or
eggs. Tarts and other sweet baked products are called “pastries.” Pastry may
also refer to the dough from which such baked products are made. Pastry dough
is rolled out thinly and used as a base for baked products. Common pastry
dishes include pies, tarts, quiches and pasties.

 

52

    Hotel Operations

Pastry is different from bread as it has higher fat content, which contributes
to a flaky or crumbly texture. A good pastry is light and airy and fatty, but firm
enough to support the weight of the filling. There mostly used pastries are

•  Short crust pastry
•  Laminated pastry
•  Puff pastry
•  Choux pastry

4.2.1 Short crust Pastry

Short crust pastry is the simplest and most common pastry. It is made
with flour, fat, butter, salt, and water. This is used mainly in tarts. It is also the
pastry that is used most often in making a quiche. The process of making pastry
includes mixing of the fat and flour, adding water, and rolling out the paste. The
fat is mixed with the flour first, generally by rubbing with fingers or a pastry
blender, which inhibits gluten formation and results in a soft, tender pastry. It
does not puff up during baking because it usually contains no leavening agent.
Short crust pastry is used to make pies such as apple pie, quiche, lemon meringue
or chicken pie. Many short crust pastries are prepared using vegetable shortening
and the composition of which lends to creating crumbly.

Short crust pastry is based on a “half-fat-to-flour” ratio. Fat (lard,
shortening, butter or full-fat margarine) is rubbed into plain flour to create a
loose mixture that is then bound using a small amount of ice water, rolled out,
then shaped and placed to create the top or bottom of a flan or pie. Overworking
the dough is also a hazard. Overworking elongates the gluten strands, creating a
product that is tough, rather than light and crumbly or flaky.
Recipe for short crust pastry
Ingredients with Quantity

•  200g of all purpose flour
•  Pinch of salt
•  100g of butter, cubed
•  2-3 tbsp very cold water

Method of Preparation

•  Place the flour, butter and salt into a large clean bowl.
•  Rub the butter into the flour with your fingertips until the mixture
    resembles fine breadcrumbs, working as quickly as possible to prevent
   the dough becoming warm.

Paper - I  Food Production - II
 

53

Fig 4.1

•  Add the water to the mixture and using a cold knife stir until the dough
   binds together; add more cold water a teaspoon at a time if the mixture
   is too dry.

Fig 4.2

•  Wrap the dough in cling film / plastic wrap and chill for a minimum of
   15 minutes and up to 30 minutes.

4.2.2 Laminated Pastry

Laminated pastry is a simple pastry that expands when cooked due to
the number of layers. It bakes into a crisp, buttery pastry. Croissants and Danish
pastry is obtained by beginning the baking process with a high temperature and
lowering the temperature to finish.

Laminated is term used for the process of alternating layers of dough
and butter when making pastry. The dough is wrapped around butter and the
packed dough is rolled out, folded over to double the number of layers, and
then the whole thing is repeated. Each time the dough is folded, it is called a

 

54

    Hotel Operations

“turn.” The more turns your laminated dough will give flakier of finished pastry.
Laminated dough includes croissant dough and Danish dough.
4.2.3 Puff Pastry

Puff pastry has many layers that cause it to expand or “puff” when baked.
Pastries are made using flour, butter, salt, and water. Pastry rises up due to the
combination and reaction of the ingredients and also from the air that gets between
the layers. Puff pastries come out of the oven light, flaky, and tender.

The gap which form between the layers is a result of the puff pastry
rising as the water evaporates into steam during the baking process. Piercing the
dough will prevent excessive puffing, and crimping along the sides will prevent
the layers from flaking all of the way to the edges.
Puff Pastry Recipe
Ingredients

•  170g  of plain flour
•  170g  of butter
•  150ml of cold water
•  1 tsp of lemon juice
•  Pinch of salt

Method of preparation

1. Sift the flour into a large mixing bowl and add the salt and 30g of the
butter. Mix the butter into the flour with your fingertips. Stir in the water and
lemon juice and mix the ingredients together to form soft dough. Turn out onto a
floured marble surface and knead further to make a firm and pliable dough.

Fig 4.3

Paper - I  Food Production - II

2. Wrap the dough and refrigerate for 30 minutes and soften the butter
a little and shape it into a rectangle that is 1in thick. On a floured surface, roll out
the dough to a similar rectangle shape but 3 times the length and 1inch wider
than the piece of butter. Place the butter in the centre of the dough.

Fig 4.4

3. Fold up the bottom third and fold the top third of the pastry down
over the butter so that it is completely covered. Press down the edges of the
dough so that they are sealed down. Turn the dough a quarter turn clockwise.

Fig 4.5

4. Roll the dough out again to the original length and fold over the top
and bottom as before. Seal the edges again and turn a quarter turn clockwise.
Repeat the same then chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. The dough can be
covered and protected with greaseproof paper.

4.2.4 Choux Pastry

Fig 4.7

Choux  Pastry is  light pastry  dough  used  to make  profiteroles,
croquembouches, eclairs, French crullers, beignets etc. It contains only butter,
water, flour, and eggs. This pastry is usually baked but for beignets it is fried.
Choux Pastry Recipe
Ingredients

4.2.5 Introduction on icing

Fig 4.12

Appierance may be an eye catching for any bakery product. The icing of
the cake improves and enhances the appearance of the cake. It makes cake attractive
and traps moisture and taste in the cake for long time. There are different types of
icings.
 
4.3 Icings and pastry cream

Icing is a creamy glaze made of sugar with a liquid, such as water or
milk that is often enriched with ingredients such as butter, egg whites, cream,
and flavorings. It is used to cover or decorate baked goods, such as cakes or
cookies.

Icing can be formed into shapes such as flowers and leaves using a
pastry bag. Such decorations are common place on birthday and wedding cakes.
Edible food colours are commonly added to icing mixtures to achieve the desired
color. Sprinkles, coloring mist, edible ink designs, or other decorations are often
used on top of icing.

Icing can be applied with a kitchen tool such as palate knife or spatula,
or by rolling the icing out and draping it over the cake. The method of application
largely depends on the type and texture of icing being used. Icing may be used
between layers in a cake as a filling, or it may be used to completely or partially
cover the outside of a cake or other baked product.

Pastry Cream is very dense, rich custard. It is a staple of French desserts
such as éclairs, and is generally used as a filling in baked goods. The most basic
pastry cream is made with vanilla, but it can also be flavored with chocolate,

 

60

    Hotel Operations

lemon, orange, or other extracts. It can also be lightened slightly with the addition
of heavy cream, if straight pastry cream is too dense for a particular recipe.
4.3.1 Basic icing and pastry cream

There are different types of icings for different purpose. They are

4.3.2 Butter cream
Butter cream

Butter cream recipe is made by creaming butter until pale with icing
sugar, vanilla and milk. This soft, buttery icing can be spread over a cake or
piped into patterns. It can also be flavoured with colour or chocolate and is
perfect for small cakes, like cupcakes. Butter cream hardens on refrigeration,
and does not keep for more than a few days. Remember to keep this icing cool
as it icing melts easily.
Butter cream recipe

•  125 g of unsalted butter, softened
•  240 g icing sugar, sifted
•  2 tablespoons milk
Beat butter in a small bowl with electric mixer until as white as possible.
Gradually beat in half the icing sugar, milk, then remaining icing sugar. Flavour
and colour as desired.

4.3.3 Fondant
Fondant

There are 2 types of fondant they are Poured fondant & rolled fondant

Paper - I  Food Production - II
 

61

Poured fondant is a creamy confection used as a filling or coating for
cakes, pastries, and candies or sweets. In its simplest form, it is sugar and water
cooked to the soft-ball stage, cooled slightly, and stirred or beaten until it is an
opaque mass of creamy consistency. Flavorings such as lemon or vanilla and
various colorings are added to the mixture.

Rolled fondant, fondant icing, is not the same material as poured fondant,
is commonly used to decorate wedding cakes. It includes gelatin and food-
grade glycerine, which keeps the sugar pliable and creates a dough-like
consistency.  It  can  also  be  made  using  powdered  sugar  and  melted
marshmallows. Rolled fondant is rolled out like a pie crust and used to cover the
cake.

Classic pouring fondant

• 450g of granulated sugar
  240g of water    2
  tablespoons light corn
  syrup.

• Pour and heat water and
   sugar into a heavy-
   bottomed saucepan in
   order tomake sugar syrup
   to a soft ball consistency.

• Put the mixture in blender
   when it comes to 135°C,

•  Switch on the blender and
   stop when it’s smooth,
   creamy, and opaque.

• Scrape into a container/
   polythene, and allow
   ripening for 12 hours or
   can bestored in
   refrigerator up to 12
   months.

• Allow the icing to cool completely before using, and if it’s
  too hard gently heat in the microwave to return to a
  spreadable consistency.

4.3.5 Royal Icing
Royal icing

Often confused with fondant, royal icing is a white meringue-like mixture
made from egg whites, acetic acid and icing sugar. Royal icing is easily made at
home, and has multiple uses. Becoming rock-hard once set, it is ideal for attaching
decorations to cakes and is a popular icing for piping.
Royal icing recipe

minutes).

Open foil, separate cloves and pass around with thick slices of warm whole-grain
bread. To eat squeeze the skin to pop the garlic. It should spread easily on the bread.

12 BUYING GUIDE

Fresh vegetables and fruits:

ASPARAGUS - Stalks should be tender and ﬁrm. Tips should be close and com-
pact. Choose the stalks with very little white -they are more tender, Use asparagus
soon -it toughens rapidly.

BEANS, SNAP - Those with small seeds inside the pods are best. Avoid beans

with dry-looking pods.

BERRIES - Select plump solid berries with good color. Avoid stained containers
indicating wet or leaky berries. Berries such as blackberries and raspberries with
clinging caps may be under-ripe. Strawberries without caps may be too ripe.

BROCCOLI, BRUSSELS SPROUTS, AND CAULIFLOWER - Flower clusters on
broccoli and cauliﬂower should be tight and close together. Brussels sprouts should
be ﬁrm and compact. Smudgy dirty spots may indicate insects.

CABBAGE AND HEAD LETTUCE - Choose heads heavy for size. Avoid cabbage

with worm holes, lettuce with discoloration or soft rot.

CUCUMBERS - Choose long slender cucumbers for best quality. May be dark or

medium green but yellowed ones are undesirable.

MELONS - In cantaloupes thick close netting on the rind indicates best quality.
Cantaloupes are ripe when the stem scar is smooth and space between the netting
is yellow or yellow-green. They are best to eat when fully ripe with fruity odor.
Honeydews are ripe when rind has creamy to yellowish color and velvety texture.
Immature honeydews are whitish-green. Ripe watermelons have some yellow color on
one side. If melons are white or pale green on one side they are not ripe.

ORANGES, GRAPEFRUIT AND LEMONS - Choose those heavy for their size.
Smoother thinner skins usually indicate more juice. Most skin markings do not aﬀect
quality. Oranges with a slight greenish tinge may be just as ripe as fully colored ones.
Light or greenish-yellow lemons are more tart than deep yellow ones. Avoid citrus
fruits showing withered, sunken or soft areas on it.

PEAS AND LIMA BEANS - Select pods that are well-ﬁlled but not bulging. Avoid

dried. spotted. yellowed or ﬂabby pods

ROOT VEGETABLES - Should be smooth and ﬁrm. Very large carrots may
have woody cores. Over-sized radishes may be pithy. Over-sized turnips, beets, and
parsnips may be woody. Fresh carrot tops usually mean fresh carrots. but condition
of leaves on most other root vegetables does not indicate degree of freshness.

Food in Vedic Times

Sanjeev Kapur

What did ancient India eat?
A prayer from the Yajurveda:

“May  for  me  prosper,  through  the  sacrifice,  milk,  sap,  ghee, 
honey,  eating  and  drinking  at  the  common  table,  ploughing, 
rains,  conquest,  victory,  wealth,  riches.  May  for  me  prosper, 
through the sacrifice, low-grade food, freedom from hunger, rice, 
barley  sesame,  kidney  beans,  vetches,  wheat,  lentils,  millets, 
panicum grains and wild rice. May for me prosper, through the 
sacrifice, trees, plants, which grows in ploughed land and which 
grows in unploughed land.”

This prayer, composed around 800 BC, gives us a pretty 
good  indication  of  the  food  of  that  period.  It  is  quoted 
from  the  eminent  food  historian  K.T.  Achaya’s  book  on 
Indian food. K.T. Achaya’s books on the history of Indian 
food are nothing less than a treasure house. He gives us a 
rare glimpse into the history and development of Indian 
cuisine. 

Food
It is believed, that the Aryans set the agricultural patterns of 
food production that still prevails in India. The cultivation 
of rice, pulses, beans, peas, wheat, linseed and even hemp 
is mentioned in the Yajurveda, but the Rig Veda does not 
mention rice or wheat, only barley (yava). Thus making 
barley one of the earliest grains known to India.

One  is  curious  to  know  about  the  food  eaten  by  the 
Aryans.  Deductions  about  the  food  of  the  Harappans 
are  made  from  the  archaeological  artifacts  but  there  is 
however, little or no evidence of their cooking habits. On 

the other hand, there are listed evidences of food eaten by 
the Aryans, in the Rig Veda and other books. Barley was 
fried in ghee and fashioned into cakes or fried and then 
dipped in honey. Bengali sweets could trace its lineage to 
this technique. Rice came in later, but went on to dominate 
the food scene. Common accompaniments with rice were 
ghee, curds, pulses or meat. Wheat though not mentioned 
in the Rig Vedas, finds a mention in the Yajurveda and the 
Brahmans. 

Amongst pulses the three prominent ones were urad, mung 
and masur. Rajma too makes an appearance and meat was 
commonly eaten. Ox, goats, birds; buffalo, humped bull 
and sheep were slaughtered for food. Animals were killed 
at ritualistic sacrifices and the meat would then be eaten. 
Dogs,  village  cock,  boar  and  carnivorous  animals  were 
considered  diet  taboos.  The  taboo  was  relented  only  for 
times of distress. However, it should be noted that meat 
eating was encouraged only when there were guests or as 
offering to the gods. 

Barley is one of the oldest grains. Rice came in much later, 
but it quickly found a place of prominence. Meat eating 
was common, but killing of animals other than for eating 
or religious sacrifices, was not encouraged.

Spices and Condiments
Salt was not common in the early Vedic times. Not only 
was  it  a  rarity  but  also  students  and  widows  were  not 
permitted  to  consume  it.  Newly  weds  had  to  abstain 
from salt for the first three days after their marriage. Salt 
was obtained from lakes, rivers, sea, swamps and mines,

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiaand was expensive. The earliest spice was mustard, sour 
citrus,  turmeric  and  long  pepper.  Later  came  in  pepper 
and asafoetida. The spice list isn’t too exhaustive, as the 
Aryans did not favour the use of spices. 

One  of  the  words  for  black  pepper  was  kari.  It  was  a 
vital ingredient in meat dishes; over the centuries kari got 
Anglicized and became curry, applying to wide range of 
seasoned dishes.

Fruits and vegetables
Fruits  were  an  integral  part  of  the  Aryan  diet.  Three 
varieties  of  jujubes,  udumbura  fruit  (Indian  fig)  and 
Saphaka  (trapabispinosa)  were  commonly  eaten,  so 
was the rose apple and mango. Radish and ginger were 
munched  on  after  meals  to  help  in  digestion. As  it  is  in 
some communities even today garlic, onion and leek were 
looked down upon. The Rig Veda mentions the lotus stem, 
cucumber  and  later  lotus  roots,  bottle  gourd,  singhada, 
aquatic  plants,  bitter  gourd,  a  variety  of  methi  for 
flavouring, mahua flowers, yam and other roots. Spinach, 
leafy vegetables, elephant yam (suran) and sweet potato 
are  also  mentioned.  Grapes,  forest  fruits  like  berries  are 
recorded  and  the  newer  fruits  mentioned  are  jackfruits, 
banana, palm, tenduka and several species of citrus fruits. 

Banks of rivers beaten by foam was where pumpkins and 
gourds were cultivated. Areas that were frequently flooded 
were used to grow grapes, long pepper and sugarcane.

Sweets and Desserts
The  earliest  sweetener  was  honey.  A  common  welcome 
drink of those days was madhuparka, a honey sweetened 
concoction  of  curd  and  ghee.  Later  jaggery  and  sugar 
dominated as sweetening agents. Rock sugar was common 
and jaggery became the base for many sweet preparations. 
Many of the sweets made in those times exist even now,

slightly or not modified. In preparations related to dairy 
products there is a mention of payasya (not payasa), which 
was the solid part of curd mixed with boiled milk, crystal 
sugar  and  herbs.  Shirkarini,  the  ancestor  of  present  day 
shrikhand  was  made  out  of  strained  curd,  crystal  sugar 
and spices.

Interestingly the Rig Veda cites honey from smaller bees 
better than the one from bigger bees.

Beverages
Milk was one of the main ingredients in the cuisines of the 
Vedic  period.  Though  cow’s  milk  was  preferred,  buffalo 
and goat milk was also used. Grains were cooked in milk 
to prepare dishes. Other by products of milk like cream 
and  ghee  were  also  used  extensively.  Curd  was  very 
popular  and  the  churning  method  was  used  to  derive 
butter.  Two  varieties  of  cheeses,  porous  and  non-porous 
find  a  mention  in  the  texts. Adults  consumed  solidified 
and clarified butter while children ate fresh butter. 

A popular dairy oriented drink was the rasala, a sweet and 
spicy curd. Speaking of drinks, one cannot have a chapter 
on food of the Vedic period without a mention of Som rasa 
or Soma. It was an exhilarating drink, which was called 
hoama in Iran and Soma in India. Soma was usually offered 
to the gods and consumed by priests during sacrifices. It 
was believed that an individual who consumed Soma was 
fortified beyond his natural abilities. 

The process of extracting the Soma juice was an elaborate 
one. The Soma plant was sprinkled with water and ground 
with a stone on other stones placed above holes that were 
connected  underground,  the  grinding  then  yielded  a 
sound  that  was  similar  to  bellowing  bulls!  The  ground 
paste was collected on a cowhide and strained through a 
sheep’s wool cloth; the sparkling liquid that was obtained 

was  mixed  with  milk,  curd  or  flour  and  consumed. 
However there are no clear leads on what exactly was the 
Soma plant. While drinking Soma was commended, Sura 
was  condemned.  Sura,  was  an  intoxicating  liquor  made 
from fermented barley or wild paddy and was consumed 
more by the Kshatriyas, but there were kings like Asvapati, 
who  proudly  declared  that  there  were  no  drunkards  in 
his kingdom. Parisruta was prepared from flowers or by 
fermenting certain grasses and Kilala was a sweet drink 
made of cereals. Masara, another drink was made of rice 
and spices, allowed to ferment for three days. Water was 
rightly called amrta or nectar.

The Aryans consumed fruit juices from a very early stage. 
Juice of the mango, jamun, banana, grapes, coconut and 
edible water lily were common.

According to the Sutras, hospitality is one of the five duties 
of  the  householder.  Eating  before  offering  to  the  gods, 
brahmans and guests was considered improper. Sacrificial 
priests, father-in-law and a king were considered specially 
deserving of hospitality, but one couldn’t disregard even a 
sudra or a lower born as a guest. Besides these, the smaller 
creatures were also fed. Purity of food and cleanliness while 
preparing food was much stressed upon. Food prepared 
overnight or that, which had gone sour, was considered 
unfit for consumption. Commercially available foods were 
discouraged, especially ones that were flavoured. 

The presence of hair, insects or rat droppings in food was 
not acceptable. Food smelt by humans or animals was not 
eaten and so was food touched by the lower castes. There 
are several rules of etiquette for dining, most of which are 
based on commonsense. Gradually as the Aryans spread 
themselves  all  over  India,  the  entire  country  adapted  to 
their ways of food and life.

Interesting trivia
• 

 The Kashyapa Samhiti (200 BC) has detailed accounts 
of every aspect of rice cultivation: sowing, irrigation, 
seed transplanting, weeding, watering, protection from 
birds (using scarecrows), defense against vermin and 
finally threshing. Even conditions for second round of 
crops are elaborated. Methods that are followed to this 
day.

• 

 Vegetarianism  was  predominant  in  India  because  of 
the sheer abundance of food available, even before the 
Vedic times. Cereals, pulses, oilseeds, vegetables, fruits 
and milk flowed freely. Nowhere else in the world one 
saw this kind of abundance. Indeed the land of milk 
and honey!

• 

 Clay, wood, metal and stone were materials commonly 
used in making utensils. Leather vessels were used for 
storing liquids. 

•  Practice of rinsing the mouth before and after eating 

was common. 

• 

• 

 Moderation  in  food  consumption  was  advocated  in 
those  times  too.  It  was  said  that  eating  only  twice  a 
day would make a person wise and intelligent. People 
fasted on the day of a sacrifice. 

 Evil  effects  of  drinking  was  put  in  the  category  of 
sins,  it  was  one  of  the  seven  sins  along  with  anger, 
senselessness and gambling.

yellow mustard crop and the sky is clear blue. Yellow is 
the color of the season. Celebrating in traditional style, the 
people  wear  yellow  color  clothes  and  cook  exotic  meals 
of yellow color. Mehfils are arranged to enjoy the music 
of Raag Basant. There is a feeling of abundance and thus 
gaiety in the atmosphere. Friends and families get together 
to enjoy the cool breeze of spring with dance and music 
and a lavish spread of yellow colored food. Besan karhi 
boils in the cauldron ready to soak freshly made pakoras, 
puffed  puris  to  be  eaten  with  pumpkin  sabzi,  tempting 
spicy diamond shaped besan qatli cooked in lagan, basanti 
aloo and fragrant yellow rice. In parts of western India it 
is dhokla and gatte ki sabzi, which dominates the scene. 
An assortment of besan ke laddoo, barfi, and katoras full 
of pumpkin kheer stamp their signature at the very end of 
the meal. 

Holi,  the  festival  of  colors,  is  one  of  the  most  strikingly 
beautiful festivals of India and falls in the Spring. 

Holi has been celebrated in India since time immemorial 
but the popularity of Holi celebrations seems to be rising 
with  every  passing  year.  Holi  is  the  time  for  fun  and 

great  historical  figures  and  events,  or  express  devotion 
to  the  deities,  saints  and  prophets.  Some  festivals  are 
common all over the country but are celebrated differently. 
Every celebration centers on the rituals of prayers, seeking 
of  blessings  and  are  connected  with  culinary  delicacies. 
Feasting  during  festivals  is  an  expression  of  the  spirit 
of  celebration.  They  are  observed  with  enthusiasm  and 
gaiety and are occasions when the family and friends come 
together. They also present women with an opportunity 
to socialize The festivals have special significance too, like 
Diwali is for the family, Karva Chauth for husband, Jamai 
Shashti for son-in-law, Bhai Dooj for brother and Raksha 
Bandhan for sister. 

The country binds relationships through its festivals and 
the burning fire in the kitchen brings them together to relish 
a variety of dishes different for each festival. The birth of a 
child, a death at the age of 100, a marriage on completion 
of an important milestone, completion of a fasting period 
is also celebrated with great gusto. In short, these festivals 
illustrate  the  unification  of  diversity  in  culture,  religion, 
and  social  aspects.  They  are  faces  and  voices  of  India’s 
ancient traditions. In these festivals, the country finds its 
many faces, its vibrant colors, and creativity of its people. 
These festivals bring life to the monotonous living of every 
day life. 

Festivals  in  India  bring  with  them  wonderful  and 
delicious  food  items.  Every  festival  has  some  special 
dishes associated with it, without which the celebrations 
are  incomplete.  India  is  majorly  an  agrarian  based 
country and most of its festivals do reflect this. Festivals, 
which  center  around  the  change  of  season  are  Basant 
Panchami,  Holi,  Nauroz  and  Bihu.  Basant  Panchami  is 
mostly  celebrated  festival  in  North  India.  Basant  means 
spring and Panchami signifies the tithi or the date which 
falls on the fifth day, of the month of Magh of the Hindu 
calendar. This is the time to usher in the season of spring 
in Northern India, it is the time when mother nature is at

India has an amazing range of glittering festivals that mark 
the calendar. These festivals are associated with culinary 
delicacies and are celebrated with much fervor and gusto. 
No  celebration  is  considered  complete  without  the  rich 
table adorned with traditional cuisine of the festival, like 
Gujya on Holi and mithai on Diwali., Haleem in Murram 
and turkey on Christmas day.

India  is  a  land  of  bewildering  diversity,  a  unique  and 
colorful mosaic of people of various faiths. These diverse, 
rich  and  colorful  cultural  currents  create  a  harmonious 
hymn known as India. They become one, retaining their 
unique individual identity. Many festivals revolve around 
the seasons such as harvest season, welcoming spring with 
joy, after the dust and heat of summer, some commemorate

bright up the festive mood. From savories to intoxicating 
drinks. Among all food Gujia is one of the most popular 
sweet dishes of Holi. It is a must for every North Indian 
home  during  the  festival  of  Holi.  There  are  ‘papris’ 
and  ‘dahi  vade’  to  add  to  the  lists.  Then  you  have  the 
intoxicating ‘bhang-ke-vade,’ kanji and thandai laced with 
bhang, which is specially made for Holi and is the most 
awaited drink of the day. Sweets are offered to the visitors 
that come and play with colors and enjoy the hospitality of 
the host. Malpuas, puranpolies and kanji vadas, kathal ki 
zabzi and dal kachori are some of the other popular dishes 
of Holi.

Navroz,  is  the  Persian  New  Year,  beginning  on  the  first 
day of the spring , 21st March. Navroz has its origin in the 
time of great kings of ancient Persia. 

The Parsi community in India celebrates the festival in its 
traditional  way.  The  New  Year  means  new  life  to  them. 
This celebration places constant emphasis on the newness 
of  life. About  two  weeks  before  Navroz,  wheat  or  other 
grain  is  sown  in  a  sandy  bed.  By  Navroz  eve  the  green 
shoots  are  well  in  evidence  and  the  clump  is  divided 
according to the number of family members, each tied with 
a colorful ribbon and set on the haft seen (seven S’s) table, 

symbolic of the roots of life. Seven food items beginning 
with an ‘S’ must be placed on the table, the number seven 
probably  relating  to  the  seven  days  of  the  week  or  the 
seven planets of the solar system. The seven items are: Seb 
(apple) Sir(garlic), Sumak (a kind of spice ) Sabzi (herbs) 
Sirka (vinegar), Sikke (coin) and a sweet pudding made 
with wheat called Samanoo. The table would also have a 
bowl of water with a green leaf floating in it, fresh fruit, 
eggs,  meat,  fish,  fowl,  sweetmeat,  pastries,  grains  and 
nuts. These are raw food all used for meals throughout the 
holiday period.

The People in the different states of South India - Karnatka, 
Andhra and Kerala, celebrate Ugadi, the Telugu New Year 
day. Gatherings of the extended family and a sumptuous 
feast  are  the  key  for  the  day.  The  day,  however,  begins 
with  ritual,  showers  (oil  bath)  followed  by  prayers,  and 
then the consumption of a specific mixture of six tastes, 
called  Ugadi  Pachhadi,  comprising  of  neem  buds,  raw 
mango, tamarind juice, green chilli, jaggery, ripe banana 
pieces  and  salt.  Every  member  of  the  family  has  to  eat 
this chutney as a ritual after offering  it to the deity. This 
mixture of different tastes symbolizes the fact that life is 
a  mixture  of  different  experiences  (sadness,  happiness, 
anger, fear, disgust, surprise), which should be accepted 
together and with equanimity.

made of hay from the newly harvested field, banana leaves 
and  green  bamboo  stalks  are  constructed  in  the  fields. 
These structures are the venue for the community feasts 
in which special meat and fish dishes are prepared. Young 
people stay up all night in the meji, singing, dancing and 
talking  around  a  bonfire.  Mouthwatering  dishes  of  fish 
like bengana khar, (a dish of eggplant and fish), sitol fish 
curry, fish fry. The sugary delights that are hard to resist 
are the lip smacking koat pitha (banana and jaggry dish) 
ghila  pitha  (jaggry  mix  with  rice),  pogi  meva  (makhana 
and jaggry) til pitha, til ladoo and doi sira.  

The festival of Makar Sankranti is also not different from 
the other Indian festivals. Makar Sankranti also referred 
to as Pongal in parts of the South, is a celebration of the 
“ascent” of the sun to the North. The festival marks the 
coldest  day  of  the  winter  (14  January),  after  which  the 
biting cold begins to taper off. In the South, prayers are 
offered  to  the  sun  god,  because  without  the  sun,  there 
would be no harvest.

During  the  festival,  the  most  commonly  eaten  foods  are 
sesame seeds and jaggery sweets, rice cooked with milk, 

Celebration in Meji Assam

In  Karnataka  a  special  dish  called  Obbattu  or  Holige, 
is  prepared.  In  Andhra  Pradesh,  a  special  dish  called 
Bhakshyalu or Bobbatlu (Puran Poli) are prepared on this 
occasion. It consists of a filling (Bengal gram and Jaggery 
/sugar  boiled  and  made  in  to  a  paste)  stuffed  in  a  flat 
roti like bread. It is usually eaten hot/cold with ghee as a 
topping or with coconut milk at some places in Karnataka.

Puranpoli 
It  is  interesting  to  note  that  there  is  no  festival,  which 
celebrates three seasons together except Bihu in Assam. 

  Bihu  is  the  most  important  festival  of Assam  observed 
to  mark  the  onset  of  new  agriculture  season  and  the 
new Assamese year and spreads over spring to autumn, 
representing three phases of human life.

This harvest festival occurs thrice a year as Rongali Bihu, 
Kati Bihu and Bhogali Bihu, special dishes made of flattened 
rice,  curds,  and  jaggery  are  prepared  and  eaten  during 
Rongali Bihu. The main feasting with exotic specialties of 
Assam is seen during Bhogali Bihu which is celebrated in 
Magha  immediately  after  the  winter  harvest.  The  word 
`bhogali` comes from bhoga which translates to `feast` and 
the festival is essentially one of feasting and merry making 
after  a  good  harvest.  Every  villager  contributes  in  some 
way or the other to this feast. Special structures called meji, 

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiajaggery and sugar drops Lots of cooking takes place on this 
day as well. Makar Sankranti is an harvest festival which 
celebrates the produce of rice all around India. A harvest 
festival is always celebrated with delicious dishes. One of 
these dishes is ‘Bandaru laddu’ - a famous Andhra sweet 
dish, another one is ‘Ariselu’ which is a popular delicacy 
of South India. Last but not the least is the `Kajji Kaayalu’, 
another mouthwatering delicacy that is made with a sweet 
stuffing. 

As mentioned, Pongal, one of the most important popular 
Hindu  four-day  festival  of  thanksgiving  to  nature  takes 
its  name  from  the  Tamil  word  meaning  “to  boil”  and 
symbolizes  the  excess  and  plentiful  of  harvest  and 
prosperity.  The  festival  is  held  in  the  month  of  January 
during the season when rice and other cereals, sugar-cane, 
and  turmeric  (essential  ingredient  in  Tamil  cooking)  are 
harvested.

Celebration of Pongal 

Tamilians  say  ‘Thai  pirandhaal  vazhi  pirakkum’,  and 
believe that knotty family problems will be solved during 
Pongal. This is traditionally the month of weddings as the 
riches gained from a good harvest are spent on expensive 
family occasions like weddings.

The harvest festival of Tamil Nadu has two main dishes 
on  its  course  as  ‘Sweet  Pongal’  and  ‘Salt  Pongal’  along 

14

with other side dishes of rice and ‘Avial’, a concoction of 
vegetables.  The  four-day  festival  has  a  variety  of  dishes 
associated with the days of Pongal. On the first day, rice, 
being central to the south Indian cuisine and also to the 
festival  itself  is  cooked  in  different  ways.  There  is  also 
vadai  (fried  chickpea  patties)  and  poli  (sweet  pancake). 
On this day only the members of the family eat together.

On  the  second  day,  the  day  of  the  celebration  itself, 
food is cooked only by the women of the house and not 
by  servants.  There  are  two  special  foods  for  this  day, 
venpongal  (mixture  of  steamed  rice  and  dal)  which  is 
salty,  and  chakkarai  pongol  (jaggery  and  ghee  mixed  to 
steamed dal and rice) that is sweet. Apart from these, rice 
in various forms – boiled, fried, sweet and salty – is also 
eaten. Sugarcane is very much a part of the festival and is 
eaten all the time in Pongal. Pongal is all about spreading 
of love and joy in the neighboring homes and enjoy the 
festival with family and friends.

In  the  months  of  August-September  the  state  of  Kerala 
celebrates  its  most  important  three  day  festival  called 
Onam. According to mythology, this land was home to king 
Mahabali-grandson of Prahlad. This three-day celebration 
is in memory of the reign of this great king. The people 
believe that Mahabali comes to Kerala at this time to see 
his subjects because of a boon granted to him by the Lord 
Vishnu. Every home in Kerala buzzes with activity during 
Onam. Boat races are organized on a grand scale.

Deliciously cooked food is served on huge banana leaves. 
Rice  is  the  main  dish  served  with  different  types  of 
vegetable  curries.  Sambhar  and    rassam  of  tomato,  lady 
finger khichdi and dosais of various kind are part of the 
meal. Curd and kheer along with banana halwa, dry fruit 
keshri,  are  part  of  the  special  menu.  Pickle  and  banana 
chips are favorite accompaniments.  

sweet is available readily in the market, and are also made 
at home. Bhog (ritual offering) is traditionally served out 
every day on the wake of the puja, which is a proper meal. 
This includes moong dal khichri (mixture of dal and rice), 
charchari (mixture of various vegetables), payesh (kheer) 
and a delicious tomato chutney indigenous to Bengal.

Although Bengalis are known for their sweet tooth, their 
puja cuisine consists of a number of spicy dishes as well. 
Nonetheless,  they  add  a  tinge  of  sugar  to  some  of  their 
dishes. Some of the Bengali spicy dishes that have gained 
popularity over the years include Chola Dal, Bandhakopar 
Dalna and Aloo Posto. Recipes cooked during Durga Puja 
period have been same over the centuries. On ‘sasthi’ the 
day of ‘bodhon’, vegetarian items are prepared: fruits and 
sweets for the women, rice, curry, dal and sweets for the 
men.  On  ‘saptami’  the  fare  is  non-vegetarian;  rice,  fish, 
cauliflower,  and  sweets  in  the  morning,  and  lobsters, 
mutton and sweets in the evening. The vegetarian recipes 
on ‘ashtami’ are similar to those of ‘sashti’. The recipes of 
‘navami’ are similar to those of ‘sashti’.

Ganesh Chaturthi
Ganesh Chaturthi touches Maharashtra in a similar way! 
Ganpati bappa Morya, Mangal Moorti Morya are sounds 
with drum beats, which fill the whole state of Maharashtra 
during this festival. This annual festival in honour of Shri 
Ganesh or Sri Ganapati has been observed for at least 250 
years, and perhaps since the 12th century. Special prasad 
and  Saatvik  food  (cooked  without  onions  and  garlic) 
are  prepared  to  mark  the  days  of  puja.  Lord  Ganesh  is 
known  for  his  inclination  towards  sweets.  therefore,  a 
festival  dedicated  to  Lord  Ganesha  is  always  celebrated 
with special sweet dishes, like modak and tilgul. Similarly 
rawa ladoo, puranpoli and ullydarai are some of the other 
traditional sweets of the festival.

Onam feast 

 Besides spring and harvest festivals, remembrance of gods 
and goddesses are also commemorated by great festivals 
in India. 

Durga Puja
The worship of Durga in the autumn (‘Shorot’) is the year’s 
largest  Hindu  festival  in  West  Bengal,  Orissa,  Tripura, 
Assam,  Jharkhand  and  other  parts  of  East  India  as  well 
as in Bangladesh. Durga Puja is also celebrated in Nepal 
and  Bhutan  according  to  local  traditions  and  variations. 
Durga  Puja  in  Bengal  is  a  carnival,  where  people  from 
all  backgrounds,  regardless  of  their  religious  beliefs, 
participate and enjoy themselves to the hilt. Durgas Puja 
is  celebrated  from  the  sixth  to  tenth  day  of  the  waxing 
moon in the month of ‘Ashwin’, which is the sixth month 
in the Bengali calender. No festival in India is incomplete 
without celebrating food. Whenever we talk of festival we 
think of the special dishes prepared for the occasion. Durga 
Puja is also one of the festivals where special emphases on 
sweets are given. This festival is mainly celebrated in the 
West Bengal, which is famous for sweets, a wide variety of

Diwali in India is celebrated with jubilation and enthusiasm. 
Diwali signifies the return of Lord Rama to his kingdom 
after being banished for 14 years. It is one of the biggest 
festivals  of  the  Hindus.  The  festival  is  celebrated  with 
lighting of Diyas, decorating houses with colorfull lights 
and  burning  of  crackers.  During  the  evening,  Lakshmi 
Puja is performed to seek divine blessings of the Goddess 
of  Wealth.  People  also  exchange  Diwali  Gifts  with  their 
dear ones. Days before the festival, the ladies of the family, 
start preparing traditional delicacies, in keeping with the 
tradition to distribute sweets to the friends and neighbors. 
So Diwali can not be imagined without sweets and savories 
that are specially made at home. The list of Diwali special 
sweets is exhaustive. Gulab Jamun, barfi, kalakand,Gajar 
Ka  Halwa,  Besan  Ke  Ladoo,  Karanji  and  Jalebis  are  the 
most  commonly  made  sweets.  But  now  with  the  fear  of 
adulteration sale of sweets has gone down tremendously 
and hampers of fruits and dry fruits have taken its place.

Apart from sweet dishes, there are several other delicacies 
that  are  made  on  the  occasion.  The  Diwali  cuisines  also 
depend upon the culture and family traditions. All across

Guru Purab
India is a secular country and many religions are practiced. 
This is a country where Hindus, Muslim, Christians and 
Sikhs  live  together  and  each  one  of  them  has  complete 
liberty  to  enjoy  and  celebrate  their  own  festivals.  Guru 
Purab, known as the “festival of the Gurus” are the major 
festivals of the Sikhs. 

The  celebrations  of  the  Guru  Purabs  are  marked  by 
celebrating  the  birth  days  of  the  ten  Sikh  Gurus.  The 
festival  is  usually  of  three  days,  two  days  before  the 
birthday;  Akhand  Path  (reading  of  Guru  Granth  Sahib, 
the holy book of Sikhs) is practiced. A procession led by 
the  Panj  Pyaras  (Five  Beloved  Ones),carrying  the  Sikh 
flag known as Nishan Sahib and the Paalki (palanquin), 
of  Sri  Guru  Grant  Sahib,  is  organized  one  day  before 
the  birthday.  This  procession  is  accompanied  by  singers 
singing  hymns,  Gatka  teams  (martial  arts)  performing 
ability and art, bands playing devotional tunes, preachers, 
and  innumerous  followers.  The  day  of  the  birthday  is 
started with Asa-di-Var (morning hymns) and other hymns 

from the holy book followed by Kathav (exposition of the 
scripture). Finally, the celebration ends with the serving of 
Langar (community lunch) in which food is served to rich 
and poor people without any discrimination in the name 
of religion, caste or sex.

Guru  Nanak  passed  away  in  1539,  leaving  behind  a 
revolutionary  movement  participated  by  all  religions 
from every part of the country to remove discriminations 
and sectarian coventions. The festivals are also sometimes 
known  as “Prakash  Utsav” which  owes its  origin  to  the 
belief of the Sikhs that Guru Nanak was the one to bring 
enlightment to the world.

Christmas
Christmas is celebrated by the Christian community living 
in  India,  the  festival  has  taken  regional  color  in  India. 
Christmas carols are sung in Hindi and midnight service 
is carried out in regional languages. Christmas celebrates 
the birth of Jesus Christ. 

In  most  places  around  the  world,  Christmas  Day  is 
celebrated on December 25th. Turkey is often regarded as 

the  central  dish  to  the  Christmas  meal  but  appeared  on 
the menu only around 1650 after European colonization of 
North America. Sebastian Cabot introduced it to Europe 
on his return from the New World. The bird got its name 
after merchants from Turkey made it a popular dish. Prior 
to this Swan, Goose, Peacock or Boar were associated with 
the Christmas feast

Traditional  Christmas  meal  varies  world  around 
according  to  their  geographical  situation.  In  Australia 
steaks  of  chicken,  in  Germany  roast  goose  accompanied 
by  vegetable,  in  USA  turkey  and  varieties  of  vegetable 
and in the U.K., Christmas pudding and mince pie are top 
food  during  Christmas.  The  largest  Christmas  pudding 
weighed  7,231  pounds  (3.28  tones)  and  was  made  at 
Aughton, Lancashire on 11 July 1992. The largest Mince 
Pie weighed 2,260 pounds (1.02 tones) and measured 6.1m 
X 1.5m. It was baked in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire 
on  15  October  1932.  Sadly  the  Pie  was  destroyed  in  a 
German  air  raid  when  the  pilot  of  a  Stuka  dive-bomber 
mistook it for a train. special Christmas beers are made by 
brewers but Champagne remains the popular traditional 
drink of the day. However in India Turkey and plum cake 
remain the favorite Christmas recipes.

various manners depending upon the prevailing custom 
and taste of the family members.

finger  prawn,  meat  patiri,  chicken  pepper  fry  and 
paalaada. After a whole month’s fating comes the festival 
of Eid-ul-fitr, the great celebration Day.

Ramadan and Eid
In India, Muslims constitute the second largest population 
group  of  the  country.  They  celebrate  their  festivals  with 
total freedom and with great gusto. The month of Ramadan 
is a month of delicious food, which is not seen in other 11 
months of the year. Like any other festival, preparation of 
iftar recipes differ from region to region. In Northern India 
– in Delhi, aloo and gobhi pakoras, fruit chat and chana 
daal savory with chopped onion and chopped coriander 
are central to every iftar table, in Lucknow shami kababs 
and parathas, chicken tikka and phirni are part of the iftar 
meal.  Whereas  in  Western  India,  in  Mumbai,  pakoras, 
pathoras,  minced  meat  samosas,  sandan,  a  savory  of 
steamed rice flour, grilled liver and spleen, chana batata 
and  sharbats  according  to  season  remain  popular  for 
iftar. Halleem is the ace food of Ramadhan in Hyderabad 
whereas  Kerala  has  its  own  flavors  like  Sabudanakheer, 

The Eid-ul-Fitr is a very joyous day; it is truly a Thanksgiving 
Day for the Muslims. On this day Muslims celebrate the 
real joy of food after starving and experiencing hunger of 
30 days. It teaches them to value food and understand the 
hardship of hunger of other less fortunate humans. It is a 
lesson in sacrifice and a test of will power. Eid is celebrated 
with cooking of qormas and biryanis, kababs and murgh 
Mussallam  and  this  delicious  meal  is  rounded  up  with 
sheer khuma and muzaffar special desserts of the Eid.

The second Eid, which in fact is only a ritual, sees delicious 
mouth watering exotic dishes of the meat. This is a festival 
of sacrifice and each family adheres to it religiously. There 
is plenty of meat in every family to prepare exotic dishes. 
Kabas sizzle on iron griddles and leg of lamb is roasted in 
tandoor, liver and lamb tikkas are on hot grill to be eaten 
hot.

A  variety  of  other  meat  dishes  like  qorma,  pasandas, 
chops,  brain  cutlets,  do-piyazas  and  varieties  of  pulao, 
besides biriyani are cooked and enjoyed with the family. 
However the specialty of the day is, whole goat filled with 
rice, eggs and dry fruits with spices.

Muharram
Muharram  though  not  a  festival  of  joy,  does  not  lack 
traditional  food  preparations,  which  also  differs  from 
region  to  region.  In  Mumbai,  the  cauldrons  of  khichra 
(lamb cooked with seven grains) cooked on coal fire are 
very inviting and in Hyderabad lagans of qubuli (a fragrant 
aromatic pulao of bengal gram) spread their aroma around. 
Badam ka sherbat and doodh ka sherbat are distributed all 
over in memory of the imams who scarified their lives in

tale  aloo  ka  salan,  which  is  distributed  to  all  after  the 
majlis at imambaras.

Jamai Shasti
A  beautiful  festival  called  ‘Jamai  Shasti’  is  celebrated  in 
Kolkata  which  displays  beautiful  bonding  of  son-in-law 
with  his  in-laws.  The  traditional  festival,  Jamaishasthi, 
originated ages ago as a part of a women’s socio-religious 
duty. The son-in-law is called ‘Jamai’ and ‘Shasti’ means 
sixth, thus the festival is observed on sixth day of shukla 
paksh in Jyestha month of traditional Hindu calendar. This 
popular social custom lays foundation of a strong family 
bonding. All the sons-in-law get a treat from his in-laws 
or ‘Shoshur bari’. The Hindu families all over West Bengal 
celebrate the day. 

A  party  is  organized  the  in-laws  for  their  daughter  and 
her  husband.  Mothers-in-law  cook  special  dishes  and 
invite their daughter and sons-in-law to honor them with 
a  feast  that  essentially  consists  of  Hilsa  fish.  Mother-in-
law performs the ritual in which a plate having six fruits 
is touched with the Jamai’s forehead. The festival plays a 
vital role in bringing the couple especially the son-in-law 
(Jamai) closer to their family thus helps in making family 
ties stronger. Bengalis are famous for their love for food. 
After  performing  the  rituals,  a  small  feast  is  organized. 
The  best  and  favorite  delicacies  of  one’s  son-in-law  are 
prepared.  The  guests  are  then  served  exotic  Bengali 
dishes.  Various  fish  delicacies,  prawn  malaikari  and  the 
most  famous  Bengali  sweet  ‘Sandesh’  are  a  must.  The 
mother-in-law fans her son-in-law with a palm leaf while 
he gorges on his food. 

In short, there is no end to Indian festival one ends and 
other  appears  with  its  own  set  of  delicacies.  It  is  an 
unending  chain.  So  live  life  to  your  best  and  enjoy  the 
festivals with their festivities and delicacies.

the battle of Karbala. In Lucknow, with a majority of shia 
population the scenario has a different color.   

During Muharram all the imambaras big or small are lit 
up and the sound of matam can be heard in every nook 
and  corner  of  the  city.  Nawab  Jiyo,  incharge  of  the  bara 
Imambara in Lucknow, said that during the days of Nawabi 
rule, Muharram was celebrated in great style. Alams and 
patkas for the Muharram procession were ordered much 
in advance. Curtains for Imambaras and veils for the rozas 
were prepared with finest zardozi work.

Besides  decoration  of  Imambaras,  food  also  played  an 
important role in Muharram celebrations. Throughout 10 
days, Nawabs, taluqdars and distinguish personalities of 
Lucknow  received  Tabarruk  from  the  Imambaras  which 
consisted of one small sheermal, 2 khamiri roti, one dish 
of lamb pulao, one bowl of tale aloo ka salan, and 1 handi 
of barfi or a bowl of zarda. 

With the end of feudal days all these practices have come 
to an end except the ordinary tabarruk of sheermal and 

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiafor  purposes  of  faith,  pilgrimage,  trade  and  commerce. 
Like  other  crafts  and  skills,  cuisine  evolved  organically 
over the decades and centuries. We know from travelogues 
of  traders  that  condiments  like  saffron,  a  local  precious 
condiment  with  established  medicinal  properties, 
remained  in  use  in  cooking  since  medieval  period  from 
around  10th  century  and  also  found  its  way  into  the 
cuisines of other regions.

Kashmiri cooking and culinary craftsmanship evolved as 
separate entities for Kashmiri Pandits and Muslims. Both 
may  favor  mutton  largely,  but  are  generally  different  in 
the way these are cooked and served. Unlike many other 
parts  of  the  sub-continent,  Kashmiri  Pandits  who  call 
themselves Brahmins, have been great mutton eaters like 
Kashmiri Muslims. Pandit cuisine uses dried ginger and 
asafoetida generously, while Muslim cookery uses onions 
and  garlic.  Another  basic  determinant  of  these  separate 
cooking practices has been use of hing mixed with curd 
by  pundits  and  shallot  mixed  with  garlic  by  Muslims. 
Mach (meat balls), kaeli (a yellow lamb or paneer gravy) 
and roganjosh (a spicy gravy with lamb chunks) form the 
essence of Pandit cookery. Pandit cooking is based on the 
gregarious  use  of  Kashmiri  red  chilli  powder,  tumeric 
and  saunf.  The  recipes  extract  their  wondrous  aroma 

from  green  and  black  cardamom,  cinnamon  and  clove 
and Kashmiri zeera or shah zeera straight from the Valley 
that  lends  these  dishes  a  divine  taste.  Mutton,  the  basic 
ingredient, remains common to both the cuisines. Pandits 
do have vegetarian feasts as well but the vegetarian meal 
is  always  a  poor  cousin.  One  specialty  relished  in  both 
non  vegetarian  and  vegetarian  pandit  cuisine  is  nadroo, 
the locally grown lotus stem cooked in curd with another 
variant of deep fried thinly sliced pieces of the lotus stem.

The  lead  cuisine  of  Muslims  is  known  as  Wazawan. As 
mentioned, Muslim cuisine has been greatly influenced by 
traders and travelers who during their sojourn in Kashmir, 
carried  cooks  as  part  of  their  entourage.  The  visitors 
transacted with local community and joined in the feasting 
which, in the process resulted in transfer of recipes as well. 
Thus, Armenian, Andalusian, Afghan and Iranian dishes 
crept in with some modification and became part of the 
Muslim cuisine. The Wazwan is a family craft transferred 
from  father  to  son,  mostly  by  way  of  apprenticeship.  It 
is an art form still practiced by the professional cooking 
families known as Wazas. The processing of raw material 
involves  converting  meat  into  raw  materials  for  various 
dishes by use of mince, pounded or finally cut pieces of 
mutton.These Wazas also claim that they are descendents

Kashmir Cuisine - A Treasure Trove

Saleem Beg

Cuisine  is  primarily  rooted  in  the  tradition,  climate,  as 
also in the availability of base materials and ingredients. 
However,  it  is  also  one  of  those  cultural  manifestations 
that have remained open to the influences from outside. 
Located  at  the  cross  roads  of  the  subcontinent  ,  Central 
and Middle Asia with borders stretching from Russia to 
Afghanistan,  Kashmir  has  been  called  a  melting  pot  of 

cultures, a crucible of thoughts and influences. Trade or 
transit  revealed  itself  as  a  social  act  that  inspired  allied 
cultural  processes  as  well.  Along  with  merchandise, 
traders of the yore brought along their living traditions of 
costumes,  life  styles  and  above  all,  the  cuisine.  Kashmir 
for reasons of history and geography has received these 
outside influences through caravans and traders visiting

and community meals is part of the celebrations. Muslims, 
mainly residing around these hospices abstain from eating 
non vegetarian food in any form. The Muslim cooks and 
the wazas, have therefore created a vegetarian cuisine for 
the  occasion  of  the  Urs  that  is  served  during  the  week. 
The multiple dishes, all based on vegetables, have names 
mostly akin to the non vegetarian dishes. As mentioned 
earlier, mutton is the otherwise the source and basis for 
the Muslim cuisine.

both  the  cuisines.  The  traditional  Kashmir  food  receives 
heat on two sides, top and bottom and the best results are 
obtained by using charcoal fire.

Cuisine  has  also  followed  and  catered  to  religious 
observances  and  practices  linked  to  the  faith.  Kashmiri 
cuisine  has  thus  adjusted  itself  and  catered  to  the  local 
spiritual  traditions.  Kashmir  has  the  distinction  of 
following a syncretic belief known as the Rishi philosophy. 
Rishis - the local saints, mostly drawn from rural Kashmir 
and  men  of  religion  owe  their  allegiance  to  the  patron 
Saint of Kashmir- Sheikh Noorudin Wali. Sheikh is a 15th 
Century  Rishi  who  propagated  monotheism,  equality  of 
all human beings before the Almighty, sanctity of living 
beings  and  respect  for  diversity.  Sheikh  in  his  poetic 
rendition  called  shruks,  mentioned  that,  he  has  drawn 
his spiritual prowess from the Lal Ded, a Shaivite yogini 
who  was  a  contemporary  of  the  Sheikh.  Besides  an 
elaborate set of teachings, he also abstained from eating 
all kinds of non vegetarian food and did not approve of 
slaughtering of animals. His followers spread the message 
and  teachings  of  the  Sheikh  throughout  Kashmir.  They 
established hospices in different parts of Kashmir where 
annual  festival  or  Urs  were  celebrated  on  fixed  days, 

of master chefs who migrated from Samarkand and parts 
of Central Asia at the beginning of 15th century with the 
influx  that  continued  during  the  following  centuries  as 
well. Wazawan, the field of delicacies has been extended 
to a range comprising of 36 courses. These delicacies are 
generally cooked at night under the expert supervision of 
Wazas assisted by retinue of wazas . Muslim cuisine is a 
gourmet, a trove of exotica to savour.

Pandits, while retaining the basic character of their cuisine 
also tried their hand on the exotica. A specific example of 
this phenomena would be soft ribs from mutton known as 
tabakmaz in Wazwan and Kabargah in the pandit cuisine. 
The method of preparation remains exactly the same for 
this  dish.  Incidentally  this  preparation  seems  to  have 
travelled from Kazakhstan where it is known by its pandit 
name- Kabargah. Over the years, condiments and spices 
took  a  `similar  color  and  the  same  spices  were  used  by

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaIt is worth mention, that the interesting difference between 
the two cuisines is, that they are served differently. In the 
case of Kashmiri Pandits, the food is served in a much more 
informal manner and remains available for hours together. 
The Muslim cuisine is served in a more formal way. Muslim 
feasts are more orderly and follow a discipline and a set 
plan. In these feasts, food is served in a large tin plated and 
carved copper plate known as trami. The guests sit on the 
floor and once the dastarkhan - printed or white cloth is 
laid on ground in a carpeted space of a dewan khana or as 
the practice is now, in a profusely decorated shamiyana or 
tent, the guests group themselves in fours. A mobile wash 
basin  made  of  copper  with  intricate  carving  known  as 
Tash-i-nari is taken around by attendants so that guests can 
wash their hands to enable them to eat with fingers. The 
trami, covered with a copper cover, a sarposh, is served 
to each group. The trami has boiled rice with finely laid 
out items like kababs, meath, tabak maz, saffron chicken, 
etc. Once the tramis are laid for the whole majlis, sarposh 
is removed from the trami and guests are then expected 
to start enjoying the feast. The cook then enters to serve 
dishes, one by one in a sequence that has not changed since 
perhaps when these dishes got introduced in the menu.

There are seven standard dishes that are must for Wazawan. 

These  are  rista,  rogan  josh,  dhania  kurma,  paneer  with 
tomato, mirchi korma, aab ghosh and gushtaba. At least 
two to three vegetables are also now part of the serving and 
these vegetable are cooked in the mutton gravy. Gushtaba- 
pounded  mutton  balls  cooked  in  processed  curd,  is  the 
final  dish  announcing  the  completion  of  servings.  Curd 
is  served  with  each  trami  along  with  accompanying 
chutneys  made  out  of  vegetables  and  seeds  like  radish, 
zirish, pumpkin etc. These accompaniments, an essential 
part  of  the  feast,  do  not  somehow  find  mention  in  the 
writings about the cuisine. Some of these accompaniments 
are zerish chetin- a chutney made of small black berry and 
tamarind pulp, red chilli powder, black pepper and salt. 
Other chutneys, are made out of onion. The gand chetin, 
pumpkin chetin are made of softened pumpkin with curd 
and honey, almond based chutney and sliced radish. These 
accompaniments are meant to neutralize the taste of one 
dish to enable the guest to appreciate and savour another 
dish.

Thus, KashmirI cuisine is a fine art that has evolved into 
an  elaborate  spread  by  integrating  local  techniques  and 
traditional  knowledge  with  influences  received  through 
interaction  by  way  of  trade,  commerce,  literary  and 
religious interactions.

Some Pathare Prabhu Recepies

Chitkala Kirtikar

Mumbai  today  is  the  hometown  to  people  of  almost  all 
the castes and communities that comprise our nation and 
to a large expatriate population. But who are its original 
inhabitants? The Kolis of course: the fishing community 
that dotted the seven islands of Mumbai from its Southern 
tip around today’s Cuffe Parade to the Northern reaches 
of  Vasai  &  Virar.  After  the  Kolis  came  the  Zoroastrian 
Parsees,  around  the  8th  Century  A.D.,  fleeing  from  the 
alien invaders of Persia. Then came the Pathare Prabhus 
(PPs)  in  the  13th  Century.  The  Prabhus  had  a  long  oral 
history  going  back  to  Lord  Ram  and  his  descendant 
Ashvapati  from  whom  they  claimed  their  own  descent. 
King Ashvapati ruled over areas around Nepal and Bihar 
and his descendants moved South and West looking for 
greener  pastures  until  in  the  13th  Century,  they  settled 
along the coast around the area that is today the country’s 
commercial  capital.  The  Prabhus  were  warriors  but  set 
great store by reading and writing and were also known 
to  be  good  account  and  document  keepers,  knowledge 

skills  that  they  carried  forward  into  the  eighteenth  and 
nineteenth centuries. With the coming of the British, the 
Pathare  Prabhus  came  into  their  own  in  the  courts  and 
offices as lawyers, solicitors, karkuns, accountants as well 
as property owners, educationists and doctors. They were 
a wealthy community, owning mainly urban land around 
the growing city of Bombay and in the nearby hill stations 
of Matheran, Khandala, Lonavla as well as the extensive 
salt pans and agricultural lands that they leased out for 
cultivation. They were not only wealthy, but also forward 
looking.  They  brought  up  their  children,  both  girls  and 
boys, to be well educated and ambitious. They were fun 
loving, lived and dressed and ate well and competed with 
the Parsees in adopting a westernized outlook and manner. 
They  started  sending  their  boys  to  London  to  become 
barristers and doctors. The girls were encouraged to learn 
music, poetry, riding, singing and to acquire professional 
training as doctors, lawyers, educationists and writers.

Another  area  in  which  the  Pathare  Prabhus 
excelled was in their cuisine. Having come to rest 
finally  near  the  coast,  they  developed  a  cuisine 
strong in sea food, coconut, cashew, bananas and 
other products of the coastal area around Bombay. 
In addition to the traditional methods of cooking, 
they  acquired  from  the  Parsees  and  the  British, 
the art of baking.

The documented history of my own family goes 
back  to  1811  when  my  ancestors,  Wasudev  and 
Jagannath Kirtikar, bought 104 acres of land for 
the  pricely  sum  of  Rs.600  from  the  Collector  of 
Land Revenue, Salsette in present day Bhayander,

used to be always packed and ready and she would be off 
visiting  family  and  friends  or  places  of  pilgrimage  with 
her faithful Bhagabai in tow, rations, kerosene stove, etc, 
neatly stowed in the trunks. At such times we missed her 
cooking and awaited her return eagerly. I give below some 
of her recipes, packaged as a menu for a generous meal for 
4 to 5 persons. It consists of 2 vegetables, 2 non-vegetarian 
recipes, rice, a sweet and accompaniments. I have selected 
simple recipes, easy to make with local ingredients readily 
available. More complicated recipes, with crabs, lobsters, 
rarely  found  ingredients  and  vegetables  can  be  made 
available  on  request/demand!  PP  garam  masala,  known 
as gode masala, adds a lot of zing and zest to vegetarian 
preparations - can be supplied on request. Excellent recipes 
for  snacks,  using  mincemeat,  eggs,  potatoes,  cabbage, 
green peas, etc, and fish preparations using coconut and 
kokum, are also available.

I have added a rice khichadi recipe with its coconut curry 
accompaniment.  The  Pathare  Prabhus  are  fond  of  hot, 
spicy food, made in generous amounts of oil or ghee. If 
you  find  the  chillies  too  much,  you  might  reduce  the 
quantities.  But  the  oil  should  not  be  reduced,  otherwise 
the taste will be un-PP like.

original  documents  of  the  sale  deed  are  available  with 
the  Director  of  Archives,  Govt.  of  Maharashtra.  I  have 
a copy of the document, the original of which is on silk 
parchment. The salt pans still exist in almost their original 
condition. Wasudev and Jagannath Kirtikar, I suspect, did 
not expend their own energies in the arduous process of 
salt  panning,  but  employed  others  for  carrying  out  the 
job.  Their  children  and  grand  children  entered  the  legal 
profession. The Kirtikar Law Library within the precincts 
of the High Court of Judicature in Mumbai is named after 
the  son  of  Jagannath.  One  of  their  descendants,  Vaman, 
my grandfather, was sent off to London in 1911 to read for 
the bar, but not before having been first married off safely

start  to  flow  out  and  meld  together.  The  salt  helps  this 
process.  Then  add  the  oil.  I  would  personally  use  more 
oil than suggested here as it imparts a good texture to the 
finished dish. Add about ½ katori of water and place on a 
low flame. The water will start to bubble. Immediately slip 
in the slices of pomfret. Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes, turning 
over the slices once so that they are evenly coated with the 
oil and spices. Serve immediately with plain fluffy rice.

Tajle Double T (lamb)
Mutton  was  always  known  as  Double  T  at  home.  The 
following is a dry preparation that goes well with rotis and 
phulkas, accompanied by the carrot salad, the recipe for 
which is given below.

Ingredients
Mutton	

Small round 
potatoes
Small onions
Coriander leaves

Ginger 
Cinnamon
Cloves 
Black pepper corns
Dhania powder 
Red chilly powder
Asafoetida (heeng)
Salt

2 tsp.
1/3 tsp.
to taste.
1/3 katori.

Method 
Thoroughly wash the mutton under running water. Place 
in  a  colander.  Place  the  colander  in  a  larger  pan  with  a 
little water at the bottom and cover. The idea is to cook the 
mutton without immersing it in water. Cook the mutton 
for 50 to 60 minutes until almost tender, but not yet tender 
enough  to  eat.  Alternatively,  you  can  pressurize  it  in  a 
pressure cooker. But do not allow it to become too tender.

In a Kadhai, preferably an iron one, add the oil and place on 
a medium flame. When the oil is warm, add the cinnamon,

add  the  steamed  mutton,  the  potatoes,  ginger,  dhania 
powder, heeng and salt. Do not cover. You can add a little 
of the water left over from the steaming if required. Let 
the ingredients cook and blend, turning them over once 
in a while so that the salt and spices are evenly absorbed. 
Once the potatoes start to soften, add the onions and red 
chilly powder. Keep sprinkling a little water and turning 
over once in a while until the potatoes and the mutton are 
soft  enough  to  eat  and  the  onions  are  well  done.  If  you 
use sufficient oil, and an iron Kadhai, (as was done by my 
grandmother),  the  spices  and  the  ingredients  will  blend 
beautifully and start browning, at the same time retaining 
their succulence. In the last few seconds of cooking add 
the chopped coriander and blend in nicely. Enjoy.

Methkutache Batatey 
(Potatoes with fenugreek)
This dish of potatoes in hot and spicy and slightly tangy 
and is eaten with plain rice and tuar dal. Very simple to 
make. You can’t go wrong with this.

Ingredients
Potatoes

3 Large round ones, peeled and cut 
into ½ cm thick roundels.
10 pods, pounded into a paste.

Garlic 
Methidana powder 1 heaped tsp.
Haldi 
Dried kokum

½ tsp.
6 to 8 slivers (you can use the juice 
of one lemon instead).
2½ tsp.
to taste.
¼ Katori

Red chilly powder
Salt 
Oil
Method:
In a thick, flat bottomed pan add the oil and place on a 
low flame. Before the oil is too hot, add the garlic paste 

28

and the methidana powder. Do not allow to brown. Add 
the potatoes, haldi, chilly powder and salt. Turn well so 
that the potatoes are well coated with the oil and spices. 
Add 1½ katoris of water. Allow to simmer, covering for 
the  first  5  minutes.  Continue  to  simmer,  open,  until  the 
potatoes are well cooked, adding a little more water at a 
time if required. One the potatoes are tender add the juice 
of  1  lemon.  If  using  dried  kokum,  soak  the  kokum  in  a 
few  spoonful  of  water  and  add  this  (kokum  and  water) 
to the simmering potatoes. Allow to simmer for a couple 
of minutes more. This is not a dry preparation. A little bit 
of moisture will remain once the potatoes are done. The 
resulting dish looks colourful and appetizing and smells 
heavenly. Use Kashmiri chilly powder and good quality 
haldi for that appealing and appetizing look!

Purnache	Bhende	(Stuffed	Bhindi)
Ingredients
Bhindi 
Onions 
Green chillies

½ Kg.
2 medium, chopped fine.
4 to 8, depending on your taste, cut 
fine.
4 tbsp.
½ tsp
1/3 tsp.
2 tsp.
1  small  bunch,  cleaned  and 
chopped
2 to 3 tbs.

to taste.
1/3 Katori.

Besan
Ajwain
Haldi powder
Red chilly powder
Coriander leaves

Fresh coconut 
grated
Salt
Oil

Method:
Wash bhindi thoroughly and top and tail. Cut each into 
2 pieces. Then slit each piece lengthwise, twice, from the 

top, and half way down, so that you can stuff the besan 
masala into each piece. Keep aside.

Prepare the besan masala by mixing together the besan, 
cut onions, green chillies, ajwain, haldi powder, red chilly 
powder,  salt  and  half  the  coriander  leaves.  Add  a  little 
water  so  that  the  besan  coheres.  Stuff  each  piece  of  the 
cut  bhindi  with  this  masala.  If  some  masala  is  left  over, 
reserve.

Place a flat bottomed pan on a medium flame and add the 
oil to it. When the oil is hot, add the stuffed bhindi to it. 
Lower flame. Sprinkle with water and cover for not more 
than  3  minutes.  Remove  the  cover,  add  the  remaining 
besan masala, if any, and allow the bhindi to cook in its 
own  moisture  on  a  low  flame.  Once  the  bhindi  is  soft, 
turn up the flame and brown the bhindi slightly, without 
burning or overcooking it. Turn off the flame and add the 
reserved coriander leaves and grated coconut to the bhindi 
blending them in. The bhindi is ready to eat. This goes well 
with puris and phulkas.

Asafoetida
Salt
Sugar 
Thick Coconut milk
Oil

1 tsp.
¼ tsp.
A pinch.
To taste.
1 tsp.
200 ml.
3 tsp.

Method
Dissolve  the  besan  in  2  tablespoons  of  warmed  coconut 
milk and ensure that all lumps blend and dissolve. Pour in 
the rest of the coconut milk, alongwith the haldi. Mix well. 
Reserve. Heat oil in a cooking pan. Add asafoetida, chillies 
and the chopped onion. Saute until the onion has softened. 
Add the pineapple pieces, the halved cashew nuts and a 
few tbsp of water and cook until the pineapple is tender 
but firm. Now add the coconut milk mixture to the pan, 
stirring continuously for 4-5 minutes. This will ensure that 
no lumps are formed and that the coconut milk does not 
curdle. Lower the heat, add the salt and sugar. Simmer the 
curry for another 2-3 minutes. Serve hot with plain rice. 

Khichadi  
(Rice with peas, onions and spices)
This  Khichadi  can  be  had  by  itself  or  with  papad  and  a 
tomato and onion kachumar. It goes well with Naralache 
Sheere, the recipe for which is also given below. But, when 
creating a menu with the recipes for fish, mutton and the 
vegetables given earlier, make plain fluffy rice to go with it.

Ingredients
Rice

Fresh Green peas
Onions

1  Katori,  washed  and  soaked  in 
water for 1 hour.
1/3 Katori.
3 Medium, washed peeled and cut 
into roundels.

Coriander leaves

Pepper corns
Cloves 
Red chilly powder
Ghee
Salt

small  bunch,  washed  and

A 1” piece.

4 to 5
1½ tsp.
¼ Katori.
To taste.

Method
To a pressure cooker add the ghee and place on the flame. 
As the ghee starts to melt, add the cinnamon, cloves and 
peppercorns.  As  soon  as  these  begin  to  sizzle,  add  the 
onion roundels and half of the salt. Turn up the flame to 
high and sauté the onions until they are partly softened. 
Do not brown. Lower flame. Add the rice, green peas, the 
remaining salt and red chilly powder. Keep turning over 
this mixture until the rice is nicely coated with the ghee 
(about 1 minute). Add the chopped coriander and mix in. 
Now add water. I normally add water by what is known 
as “andaz”: 2½ katoris of water should do. The rice should 
be submerged, about ¾” under water. Cover with pressure 
lid, keep the flame on high and wait until the first whistle 
goes. Turn off the flame. Do not open immediately. Wait 
until the steam has been absorbed. Serve and eat hot. This 
Khichadi has a delicious aroma and a lovely honey brown 
colour.

Naralache Sheere (Coconut milk curry)
I ought to explain at the outset that the way coconut milk 
was  extracted  by  my  grandmother  was  a  laborious  one 
and involved first selecting a coconut, shaking it to ensure 
it had a good quantity of water inside (the sign of a good 
coconut), then breaking it open, saving the coconut water 
(or  drinking  it  right  away),  then  scraping  out  the  white 
flesh which was then ground on a stone using a little warm 

water.  The  milk  of  the  ground  flesh  was  then  squeezed 
out  into  a  container  with  your  bare  hands.  This  process 
was repeated twice using a separate container each time 
until the coconut flesh had given up all its delicious milk 
and  was  reduced  to  dry  chaff.  This  milk  of  3  different 
consistencies in the 3 different containers, was then used 
for different purposes, including making curry. The daily 
help who arrived in the morning was well attuned to this 
task  and  carried  it  out  cheerfully.  To  make  things  easy, 
you can use coconut milk powder. I find that the Maggi 
coconut powder is nearest to the taste of the original.

Ingredients
Onions
Tomatoes
Green chillies
Coriander leaves

2 medium, chopped fine.
2 medium chopped fine.
4, cut into 3 pieces each.
1  medium  sized  bunch,  cleaned 
and chopped.

powder mixed smoothly into 3 katoris of water.
Haldi
Red chilly powder
Salt
Sugar

¼ tsp.
1 tsp.
To taste.
A pinch if desired.

Method
In  a  thick  bottomed  deep  pan  mix  together  the  onions, 
tomatoes,  green  chillies,  coriander,  haldi,  red  chilly 
powder and salt. Mix well, crushing together slightly with 
the  fingers,  so  that  the  natural  juices  mix  well  together. 
Place this mixture on a low flame. Since there is no oil or 
water  in  this,  keep  stirring  and  mashing  with  a  spoon. 
The  onions  and  tomatoes  will  soften  and  release  a  little 
moisture.  At  this  stage  add  the  coconut  milk  and  keep 
stirring until the mixture comes to a boil. Add a pinch of 

sugar if so desired.

Immediately remove from the flame and serve hot.  This 
sheere goes well with the Khichadi or even with plain rice.

your fingers over the base and sides of a square or round 
baking dish. A Borosil bowl will do. Dust the inside of the 
dish with flour. Pour the semolina mixture into the baking 
dish. The mixture should be of pouring consistency. If not, 
add a little more warmed milk.

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiarotli/bhakhri/rotlo, rice/khichadi. The sweet dish is placed 
outside the plate as is a glass of chaas (thin buttermilk). 
As you sit at the table and begin the meal, the rotlis are 
served  hot  and  all  items  replenished  as  you  want  them. 
The idea of spooning different items in katoris (or vadkis), 
I am told by Hasmukh Shah, former President, Heritage 
Trust, Baroda, probably goes back to the description of a 
meal as ‘8 vadki nu jaman’, ‘6 vadki nu jaman’ and ‘4 vadki 
nu jaman’ (a thali meal with 8 katoris would be a banquet 
meal). According to the importance of the guests invited 
to the meal, the presiding housewife would decide which 
‘jaman’ to prepare and serve!

The thali as a restaurant product first made its presence felt 
sometime in the 1970s. I remember eating my first thali at 
a restaurant called Sabras in Ahmedabad. The restaurant 
closed but the thali took off like a hot roti (amongst both 
Gujarati  and  non-Gujarati  families!)  and  continues  to 
reign  as  the  most  popular  regional  ‘sit-down-served-at-
the-table’ buffet. This spawned several me-too thalis in the 
process – the Punjabi thali, Rajasthani thali, Bengali thali, 
Periyar  thali,  and  so  on.  What  continues  to  puzzle  me, 

however, is why would Gujju families who generally have 
DBRS (Dal-Bhaat-Rotli-Shaak) almost every day for lunch, 
want to go out in a restaurant and eat the same thing? 

By  and  large,  Gujaratis  are  vegetarians,  though  there 
are also enough communities in the state who are meat-
eaters and have developed wonderful recipes with not just 
chicken, mutton and seafood but also game meat. There is 
an amazing Eedapak (Egg barfi!) that was demonstrated 
by an aging Parsi matriarch from Navsari on chef Aditya 
Bal’s ‘Lost Recipes’ TV show on the Epic channel. But the 
globe-trotting Gujarati veggie has almost single-handedly 
introduced world cuisine to the infinite possibilities and 
flavours of vegetarian food and cooking. Most airlines now 
offer the ‘Jain’ meal option, unheard of a decade ago, but 
equivalent to getting brownie points for vegetarianism. 

It is common knowledge that Gujaratis are enterprising, 
business-minded  people,  willing  to  take  risks  and  tread 
into  the  unknown.  Surat  and  Bharuch  on  the  southern 
coast of the state, Khambhat at the Gulf of Cambay have 
been  very  important  trading  posts  for  centuries,  with 

The Big, Fat Gujju Thali!

Sandhya Bordewekar Gajjar

Every  time  anyone  takes  a  bite  into  food  in  India,  the 
flavor  of  Gujarat  mingles  in  their  mouths.  That  flavor 
comes from salt, as almost 80% of Indian salt is harvested 
in this western-most state. It is no wonder that at dawn 
on the Hindu New Year’s day during Diwali, salt sellers 
rush about in every residential area throughout the state, 
yelling ‘Sabras lo!’ They give a handful of salt crystals in 
return of ‘baksheesh’ and the housewife switches on the 
Diwali lights and mixes the salt crystals in her kitchen’s 
salt jar. This ‘Sabras’, that adds taste to food, also promises 

good luck and year- round prosperity to the family.

In addition to salt, Gujarat has given one more culinary 
jewel  to  Indian  cuisine  –  the  thali.  The  Gujarati  thali 
offers  a  complete  meal,  in  terms  of  nutrition  as  well  as 
appeasement of the taste buds! It is a visual delight as well 
– a large metal plate with numerous colourful katoris filled 
with  at  least  three  different  vegetables,  kathol  (pulses), 
daal/kadhi, raita, and on the rest of the plate, a kachumbar 
(salad),  couple  of  pickles,  chutney  and  farsan,  papad,

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiabusiness links to merchants from Europe, East Africa, the 
Middle  East,  and  South-East Asia.  Gujaratis  travelled  to 
these countries in search of work and fortunes, took their 
culinary expertise with them but were also willing to be 
experimental  and  accepting  of  the  foods  and  flavours 
that  they  encountered  in  these  countries.  Just  last  year, 
in Rajkot, I found a tiny grocery store selling all the basic 
ingredients required for Sudanese cooking popular with 
the  Saurashtra  Gujaratis  who  had  lived  and  worked  in 
Sudan and for some reason have returned to the homeland 
but crave Sudanese delicacies. For the last few years, the 
Rander village on the outskirts of Surat has become very 
popular  for  the  Burmese  adapted  vegetarian  and  non-
vegetarian dishes that were prepared during the Ramzan 
month. Foodies drove down all the way from Mumbai and 
Ahmedabad to taste these dishes. A report in the Times of 
India  this  Ramzan  wrote  that  the  locals  are  planning  to 
have this popular ‘night eats’ market throughout the year 
and not limit it to Ramzan only! It is not for nothing that 
there is a saying in Gujarati –Surat nu jaman ane Kashi nu 
maran! (Surat to eat and Kashi to die!)

Since  the  late  1960s  and  especially  after  Idi  Amin’s 
expulsion of Asians from Uganda, Gujaratis began moving 
to the UK, USA and Canada as safer countries for work 
and often immigration. In the 1980s, Australia and New 
Zealand  were  added  to  these  destinations.  The  popular 
foods  of  these  regions  obviously  have  dominated  the 
young Gujarati’s palate in current times – pizzas, burgers, 
donuts,  footlongs,  hot  dogs,  and  with  them  a  range  of 
Tex-Mex stuff like tacos, enchiladas, and what-have-you. 
Even local Gujaratis, who may not have travelled much, 
are not averse to trying out new cuisines, even if it means 
smothering the plate with tomato ketchup if the taste does 
not go down well. Middle-eastern foods, that share a kind 
of spicy taste as Indian foods, are a rage, as are the ‘desi 
Chinese’ preparations that have nothing even remotely to 
do with China, except maybe the soy sauce.

Eating out – a concept generally frowned upon in Gujarati 
households  till  about  three  decades  back  –  is  now  de 
riguer. A Facebook page, Food Addicts in Ahmedabad and 
Foodies in Baroda is one of the most active with followers 
increasing  by  the  day.  Their  updates  share  information 
about new restaurants, evaluate the fare served on taste, 
quality, pricing and service, and most recently, with typical 
Gujju gusto, a debate has been initiated on cheating by most 
restaurants on calculation of taxes and service charges on 
the final bill! The page also provides excellent platform for 
those  who  want  to  publicize  their  food  ventures  –  tiffin 
services, pop-up kitchens, meal deals, and one of the most 
valuable, where to get food in the city between midnight 
and 4 am!

Gujarati  cuisine  is  elaborate,  wonderful,  and  multi-
dimensional though a tad on the sweet side. The Kathiawadi 
(Saurashtra) and Kachchhi cuisines are different in some 
ways from the mainstream Gujarati but each region has 
its own magical and mouth-watering range of savory and 
sweet delights. Let’s look at a few here …

Gujju  Fast  Foods:  The  most  popular  is  the  Kachchhi 
Dabeli with roots in the town of Mandvi. A local version 
of the Vada-Pav, the potato vada is jazzed up with fried 
groundnuts and a sprinkling of pomegranate seeds! Recent 
favourites are ‘live’ dhokla and piping hot ‘papdi no loat’ 
(rice flour cooked in hot water, ground green chillies and 
ajwain, served with a spoonful of cold oil). Certain places 
have also become popular for specific foods. For instance, 
Kanjari  village  in  Anand  district,  is  known  for  its  fried 
patras  in  the  colacosia  season!  The  regular  nasta  foods 
such as handvo, muthiya, khaman, khandvi, kachori, and 
thepla still rule the Gujarati kitchen. Fresh fafda and jalebi 
continue  to  be  the  hottest  breakfast  all  over  Saurashtra! 
The influence of Marathi fast food in Vadodara (as a result 
of the Gaekwadi influence) can be seen in the perennial 
popularity  of  sev-usal  for  years  and  in  recent  times,  the 

35

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiaresurgence  of  sabudana  vada  and  sabudana  khichadi 
served at roadside larries. 

Festive  Fare:  From  the  month  of  Shravana  to  the  Holi 
festival  in  Phaguna,  Gujaratis  are  almost  constantly 
celebrating  some  festival  or  another.  Vedmi  (puranpoli), 
laadoo  (fried  wheat  flour  patty  pounded,  mixed  with 
sugar/jaggery and rolled in poppy seeds), garam maghaz 
(with  besan  flour),  jalebi,  dudhpak,  shiro  are  the  old 
favourites while lapsi (made with broken wheat) is a must-
have on every happy occasion. Seasonal delicacies such as 
gulabpak and khajoorpak in Kachchh and adhadiya (from 
urad dal) in Saurashtra in the winter are traditional and 
popular, never mind the ghee-induced cholesterol issues.

Rural  Fare:  In  most  villages,  rotlas  made  from  bajra, 
maize  and  jowar  are  the  staple,  and  khichadi  with  milk 
or  buttermilk  is  served  for  dinner.  Breakfast  is  usually 
the  leftover  rotla  broken  into  pieces  or  the  khichadi 
mixed  with  buttermilk,  salt,  turmeric  and  green  chillies 
and  given  a  tadka  with  mustard  seeds  and  asafoetida. 
Totally yum! In urban homes, old-timers still do the same 
with leftover rotis. This was a favourite with late potter-
ceramist Kumud Patel and her sisters and I was privy to a 
mild quarrel that broke out in her home when one of the 
sisters polished off the ‘Vaghareli rotli’ without sharing it 
with the others! The famous Gujarati undhiya is actually a 
much simpler rural celebratory and communal feast with 
the winter harvest of new potatoes, brinjals, beans, sweet 
potatoes – all lightly spiced with salt, ajwain and oil, and 
put  separately  in  clay  matkas  whose  mouths  are  sealed 
with a local weed growing in the fields. Then the matkas 
are  upturned  (hence  the  name,  undhiya),  put  in  a  large 
hole in the ground, covered with hay and given a bhadko. 
The farmers know for how long to keep stoking the fire till 
the veggies in the matkas are cooked. The cooked veggies 
are served on leaf plates and each person has to peel his 
own  veggies,  then  mash  them,  pour  a  little  oil  and  mix 

36

in the fresh chilli chutney and the garlic chutney and eat 
it. A version of this undhiya, called ubadiya is popular in 
the winters in south Gujarat and makeshift stalls come up 
along the entire western highway from Vapi to Valsad in 
these 2-3 months. Personally, I find it way better than the 
undhiya!

Darbar Fare: Gujarat was made up of hundreds of large 
and small princely states. The erstwhile rulers are either 
Rajput  Hindus  or  Nawab  Muslims.  They  are  popularly 
known  as  Darbars  and  their  modest  palaces  are  known 
as Darbargadhs. They are usually non-vegetarian unless 
they have accepted the Swaminarayan way of life (as has 
happened  with  many  Darbars  in  Saurashtra).  Many  of 
them were avid shikaris before hunting game was banned 
so their scrumptious dishes made with venison, partridge, 
wild  boar,  hare,  grouse  are  now  adapted  to  mutton  or 
chicken. The Maharaja of Sailana, Digvijaya Singh’s classic 
book, Cooking Delights of the Maharajas, has recipes from 
the Maharaja of Bhavnagar (Mokal Bhavnagar), and from 
Mallik Saleem Khan Saheb of Dasada (Kofta Saleem), 

an  unholy  mix  of  chaats  and  chilli  paneer,  pasta  and 
pizza, noodles and naans, tawa fry and tindola rice, is the 
traditional Gujarati lagan nu jaman – with daal and ladoo, 
vaal  (these  have  completely  disappeared,  replaced  with 
indifferently made chole or rangooni vaal), flawar-bataka 
nu  shak,  puri  and  shrikhand.  This  is  a  really  sad  story, 
because this phenomenon is reaching villages too.

Wedding  Feasts:  The  worst  hit  cuisine  in  the  turmoil 
wrought  by  the  crazy  desire  to  serve  a  buffet  spread  of 

Parsi  Cuisine:  Among  the  most  adaptable  and  joyous 
‘immigrants’  to  Gujarat  are  the  quickly  depleting  Parsi 

community whose ancestors, fleeing religious persecution 
in  Persia,  landed  on  the  coast  of  Sanjan,  near  Navsari. 
Hearty eaters, the story of their acceptance is also food-
related.  The  king  of  Sanjan  sent  a  glass  of  milk  filled  to 
the brim with his minister to the leader of the Parsis. The 
elderly Parsi looked at the glass and understood what the 
king wanted to say. He took a spoonful of sugar and gently 
slipped  it  in  the  milk,  stirring  carefully  till  it  dissolved 
and sent it back. The king received it, tasted the milk and 
allowed the Parsis to land and live in his kingdom. The 

37

sweetening the environment wherever they are, especially 
if  there  is  an  egg  around!  Broken  over  a  skillet  of  fried 
potato  or  bhindi  sabzi,  the  iconic  bhinda  par  eenda,  the 
delightful akoori (scrambled eggs, the secret being the eggs 
are broken into cold oil), and the very popular dhansaak 
(meat cooked with vegetables and a mix of different dals), 
are  Parsi  favourites  that  have  made  their  way  into  non-
Parsi Indian kitchens as well.

Frugal Foods: Like in all regions, there is a range of frugal 
foods that one looks forward to when not feeling too well, 
when  the  rich  and  spicy  fare  makes  you  nauseous,  or 
simply because it is what your mother fed you as a child. 
The most popular frugal food is the humble khichadi, made 
with rice mixed different dals and sometimes vegetables 
too. My friend, architect Nandita Amin, ardent foodie and 
avid globetrotter, says, “The day I come home from any 
of  my  travels,  I  need  to  have  a  meal  of  simple  khichadi 
and dudhi (the humble bottle-gourd) nu shaak!” But there 
are other kinds of frugal foods too in the state, especially 
in  rain-scanty  regions  such  as  Saurashtra  and  Kachchh 
where  fresh  vegetables  may  be  scarce  or  expensive.  For 

38

instance, my mother-in-law sundried cleaned watermelon 
peels  that  would  otherwise  be  thrown  away,  and  stored 
them for use in place of regular vegetables in the summer. 
Vegetables  that  were  very  cheap  in  the  season,  such  as 
cluster beans (gawar), or discarded parts of fruits, such as 
mango seeds (gotlas) were also dried in the hot summer 
sun and stored for future use.

Pickle Pots: Pickles are the mainstay of Indian kitchens. 
They  make  excellent  accompaniments  with  rotis/rotlas 
as  well  as  with  khichadi,  especially  in  the  absence  of 
vegetables,  in  times  of  shortages  induced  by  droughts, 
floods,  famines,  or  when  the  housewife  is  too  tired  to 
go  out  and  shop  for  foodstuffs.  Pickles  in  Gujarat  use 
various kinds of fruits and vegetables and can be sweet or 
savoury or sometimes a delicately balanced mix of both. 
Pickles are so popular and so widely prepared by almost 
every household that Gujarat even has a ceramic hub – at 
Thangadh – to make the cream and brown ceramic, glazed 
bottles to store the pickles in!

Sadya - The Kerala Feast for  

Body, Mind & Spirit

Chef Narayanankutty, Kalari Rasayana, Kollam

Sadya  is  a  vegetarian  Kerala  feast  of  varied  colours, 
textures, consistencies & tastes with parboiled rice as the 
staple.  The  number  of  dishes  in  a  Sadya  are  many  and 
can  go  up  to  65  or  more  depending  on  the  will  of  the 
host to satisfy his guests. It is always served on a banana 
leaf  as  per  the  traditional  gastronomic  rules  and  eaten 
by hand utilizing all the five fingers which are said to be 
the conduits of the five elements that constitute our body 

(Fire, Air, Ether, Earth & Water). Kerala’s Hindu tradition 
is predominantly vegetarian and their everyday meal also 
consists of rice with fewer vegetarian curries than a Sadya.

The current lavish form of Sadya was instituted by the 18th 
century  King  Marthandavarma  of  Travancore  dynasty 
who ordered healthy & princely meals for Brahmin priests 
reciting the Four Vedas (holy books) in 90 days (Murajapa) 

39

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiaas a penance for the lives lost while conquering the nearby 
smaller  Princely  States  to  form  the  larger  Travancore 
Kingdom. 

Kerala  had  an  agrarian  tradition  and  every  household 
was  self-sufficient  for  its  food  needs.  All  the  vegetables 
that went into a meal were picked from the garden in the 
homestead.  So,  the  meal  was  organic  and  had  seasonal 
and  regional  variations.  Because  there  are  so  many 
elements in a Sadya, the pickles and crisps, that would last 
for a few days, were prepared a day or two in advance. 
Other  preparations  began  at  the  crack  of  dawn,  so  that 
everything would be ready by lunch time. Sadya feast is 
only for lunch and dinner is always a lighter meal. 

What goes into a Sadya?
The course in a Sadya are pretty standard. It has:-
1.  Ozhikkan (to pour, mix and eat) 
2.  Koottan (to mix and eat) 
3.  Nakkan (to lick) 
4.  Maduram (sweet)
5.  Kadikkan (to bite)
6.  Staple rice and a palate cleanser called olan in between

It  starts  and  ends  with  dishes  that  calm  the  stomach, 
beginning with a daal (lentil) & ghee, served with hot rice 
and ending with buttermilk to aid digestion. Salt, pickles, 
upperi  or  crisps,  pappadom,  plantain  and  the  various 
curries except the pouring curries are laid out on the leaf 
prior to the arrival of the guest and at room temperature. 
Rice and curries meant for pouring consistency are served 
hot when the guest sits down to eat. The pickles (mango, 
lime, ginger curry and kichdi) and crispies are placed on 
the  left.  Then,  the  other  dishes  meant  to  be  mixed  with 
rice (Kuttan) and eaten, like avial (a mixed vegetable) and 
other curries are served in a line along the top half of the 
leaf.  The  rice  is  served  on  the  lower  half  with  pouring 

40

curries,  which  are  daal  &  ghee,  followed  by  sambar  (a 
lentil-based,  mixed  vegetable  curry).  Payasam  makes  an 
entry at the last. The meal is rounded off with a little rice 
and buttermilk /rasam to settle the stomach.

Etiquette	of	eating	on	a	banana	leaf	(ela)
Traditional etiquette of eating on a banana leaf, have slight 
regional differences. Largely, the narrow part of the leaf 
faces the left, there by the cut side to the right. Sometimes, 
people  will  lightly  wet  the  leaf  as  they  sit  down  for  the 
meal and give it a wipe with their hand. After the meal, 
the leaf is folded down the middle way from the person. In 
the olden days, guests used to sit on the floor with crossed 
legs with the leaf also on the floor or short stools and short 
tables with leaf on the short tables, but today people find 
it inconvenient and the Sadya is served at the table. Sitting 
on  the  floor  and  eating  helps  in  better  digestion  due  to 
an  additional  blood  circulation  at  the  digestive  tract. 
Traditionally,  the  elder  in  the  house,  called  a  karnavar, 
would  point  out  to  whoever  was  serving,  that  a  person 
needed a second helping of a curry or rice.

Healthy and local
Whether it is the feast Sadya or a normal meal it is the vedic 
wisdom  handed  over  from  generations.  It  encompasses 
food as nature in its purest form, slow cooked (Mannagni) 
and  eaten  slowly  with  reverence  (mindful  eating).  The 
Sadya  might  seem  like  an  overly  heavy  meal,  but  it  is 
prepared with local, fresh, seasonal and whole ingredients 
and  is  suited  to  the  environment.  It  is  a  balanced  meal 
that packs in the six tastes prescribed in Ayurveda - sweet, 
sour, salty, bitter, pungent and astringent. Since the Sadya 
incorporates all the tastes, it satiates one’s palate and one 
does not tend to overeat. 

Although Sadya is based on the Hindu traditions it is now 
a tradition by people of all class and creed, depicting the 
secular character of the Kerala State!

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiamuch difficulty. Traditional Saraswat cooking is not very 
spicy  and  is  therefore  nutritious  and  good  for  health.  I 
have  laid  special  stress  on  such  recipes  and  methods  of 
cooking”.

The  next  Saraswat  Cook  book  called  “The  Konkani 
Saraswat  Cook  Book”  was  published  with  a  second 
edition coming out in 2014. I have enclosed photographs 
of both the cook book covers. I am also quoting from the 
author’s note written by Asha S. Philar. “As we took the 
book forward, we discovered that Konkani Saraswat food 
has  a  ‘whole-earth’  approach  with  its  use  of  vegetables, 
roots, shoots, leaves, pulses and grain. Peels, pith, flowers 
and seeds have their place, as do traditional practices of 
storing  food  past  the  season.  They  represent  simplicity, 
thrift, intentions to conserve limited resources, all of these 
with  an  eye  to  nutrition.  The  cuisine  also  has  charming 
departures from the expected, for example a kheeri which 
is ‘cheppi’ (non-sweet) and a salad of broken pappads.”
SARASWAT RECIPES
(Most recipes unless otherwise indicated, serves about 6)

Khotte

The Chitrapur Saraswat Community is a small community 
of about 25,000 with its own distinct style of cooking. It 
is not very spicy with the exception of a few dishes. The 
first attempt to make it into a cook book was made by the 
late Ambabai Samsi as early as the mid 1930’s. She had it 
completed in manuscript form along with an author’s note. 
Unfortunately  she  passed  away  very  suddenly  in  1938. 
So  it  was  left  to  her  daughter-in-law  the  late  Kalyanibai 
Samsi, who with the help of a few other ladies published 

the  first  edition  in  Marathi  in  1943  under  the  name  of 
“Rasachandrika”, followed by an English edition in 1988. 
In  her  author’s  note Ambabai  Samsi  says:  “Since  formal 
academic  education  has  now  become  more  widespread 
than in my time, girls cannot devote much time to cooking 
till they are about 20. As a result it becomes very difficult 
when  they  first  undertake  the  responsibility  of  cooking. 
Under these circumstances Saraswat girls can refer to this 
book and start cooking typically Saraswat dishes without

ghee. Sprinkle a little riceflour or cornflour over the ghee. 
Place a 2nd puri on the 1st one a little further away from 
the edge (‘in staircase’ formation). Repeat the process of 

smearing the ghee and riceflour on each roti placed. When 
you have stacked 7 puris in this ‘staircase’ formation, fold 
in the sides and fold into a roll. Cut the roll into thin discs 
about a sixth of an inch thick. Lightly roll out each slice 
into a thick puri without pressing it too hard. When all the 
puris for the phenori are ready, deep fry them in hot oil

The Allure of Rich Punjabi Cuisine

Davinder Kumar

Punjab is a combination word, in Persian, Punjab means 
Punj (Five) and Ab (Water). It is the “Land of the Five” 
–  the  Beas,  Satluj,  Chenab,  Ravi  and  Jhelum  rivers  and 
is  also  India’s  granary-  producing  more  than  half  of  the 
wheat, rice and millet grown in the country. The fertility of 
its fields and the richness of its dairy produce are the envy 
of the subcontinent. The earliest references to the region’s 
food  were  made  in  the  ancient  Hindu  Vedic  scriptures 
more than 3,000 years ago.

Punjab  has  experienced  diverse  culinary  influences. 
Its  proximity  to  Persia,  Afghanistan  and  Central  Asia 
cultivated a taste for fresh and dried fruits and exotic nuts. 

The  rich  streams  of  Hindus,  Sikhs  and  nomadic  Pathan 
tribes have, over the millennia, enriched the cuisine and 
Punjabi  people  have  lovingly  cherished  and  preserved 
their far-reaching tastes and eclectic cooking traditions. 

The  Partition  of  India  in  1947  brought  unprecedented 
numbers of Punjabi refugees to the rest of the country, who 
carried with them the rich diversity of their food. A string 
of Punjabi roadside restaurants called dhabas sprang up all 
over the larger cities and mushroomed on every highway. 
Dhabas started not as a business proposition, but as the 
refugees’ basic need for survival.

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaThe  remains  of  an  ancient  tandoor  oven  have  been 
discovered  in  an  excavation  at  the  Indus  Valley.  Today, 
the  oven’s  widespread  popularity  should  be  credited 
to  the  intrepid  and  extremely  mobile  Punjabi  people. 
The  cuisine  in  Punjab  is  exceptionally  responsive  to  the 
changing seasons. Winter is welcomed with Makke ki roti 
and Sarson da Saag.

In  1947,  the  greater  Punjab  (British  Punjab  of  1903)  was 
divided  into  two  Punjab:  Pakistani  Punjab  and  Indian 
Punjab.  The  North  West  Frontier  Province  was  also 
influenced  with  Bukhara  style  cooking.  Baluchistan  and 
the Province of Sindh also influence Punjabi cooking due 
to their close proximity.

The cuisine of Punjab has an enormous variety of mouth-
watering  vegetarian  as  well  as  non-vegetarian  dishes. 
The  spice  content  ranges  from  minimal  to  pleasant  to 
high.  Punjabi  food  is  usually  relished  by  people  of  all 
communities and home cooking differs from the restaurant 
style cooking. In restaurants, the chefs make a liberal use of 
desi ghee, butter and cream to make the food delicious and 
finger licking. On the other hand, at home, people prefer 
using sunflower oil or some other refined oil for cooking, 
with the basic idea of making the food low in fat content, 
with minimal usage of butter and cream.

Wheat flour is the staple food of Punjabis; however, they do 
enjoy eating rice on festivities and other special occasions. 
When  it  comes  to  food,  each  region  in  Punjab  has  an 
entirely different preference - like people in Amritsar are 
particularly fond of stuffed paranthas and milk products. 
The philosophy of life for most of the Punjabis is to eat, 
drink and be merry. While preparing Punjabi food onion, 
ginger  and  garlic  are  used  extensively  to  enhance  the 
flavours. 

Traditional Punjabi thali consists of varied kinds of breads; 
some are baked in the tandoor such as tandoori roti, laccha 
paratha, naan and kulcha, while others are dry baked on 
the  tava  (pan)  like  chapatti  and  jowar  ki  roti.  There  is 
another fabulous variety of roti called rumali roti, which is 
thinner and larger in size as compared to the normal one 
and is also easily absorbable. There are also breads that are 
shallow fried such as parantha and deep-fried such as puri 
and bhatoora.

Popular Dishes
The  food  items  that  form  a  part  of  the  traditional  foods 
of  Punjab  are  so  eye-catchy  and  tempting  that  you  can 
hardly resist them. Some of the popular delicacies of the 
State are - Sarson ka Saag, Makki ki Roti, Dal Amritsari, 

Choley, Shahi Paneer, Tandoori Chicken, Butter Chicken, 
Rarha Meat, Amritsari Machli, Kadhi and more.

but an exuberant use of masalas, with a touch of pure ghee 
is what works best.

The  local  cuisine  of  Punjab  is  heavily  influenced  by  the 
agriculture and farming lifestyle that has been prevalent 
for  centuries.  The  people  in  this  State  generally  go  for 
spicy  food  and  use  oil  and  ghee  to  considerably  higher 
levels. There are no intricate marinades or exotic sauces, 

Punjab  is  a  major  producer  of  wheat,  rice  and  dairy 
products, which form the staple diet of Punjabi people and 
the people of Punjab prefer wheat to rice. In roti itself, you 
find such a wide variety that you are left to wonder how 
versatile the cuisine is?

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaHyderabadi Cuisine

Salma Hussain

It is believed that one of the ways to judge the greatness 
of a culture is to look closely at its cuisine. Old Hyderabad 
was  famous  for  its  hospitality,  generosity  and  cuisine. 
Wedding  feasts,  celebrations  and  parties  were  common 
place and were occasions for people to demonstrate their 
hospitality.  Hyderabadi  cuisine  today  is  known  all  over 
the world for its special nature and its infinite variety. It 
has few peers in the sub-continent for sheer range as well 
as delicacy of taste. Let me list out some of the well-known 
culinary dishes of Hyderabadi food.

Tutak-Luqmi  –  (among  many  kinds  of  starters),  Pasinda 
Khabab, Sheekh Kabab – Chaal ke kabab – Nargisi Kofta 
–  Shikampur  and  Shaami  Kababs,  Biryani  Khaam  and 
Biryani  Zard/Zafani  combined  with  Dum  ke  Baingan  / 
Baghaare  Baingan,  Mirch  Ka  Saalan,  Kulti  ka  cut.  Joban 
Malti or Maati was another exquisite culinary preparation 
cooked  on  special  occasions.  Several  varieties  of  breads 
including Baqar khani roti, Mullah dupyaza ki roti, Bibi 
marium ki roti, Sheermal, Kulcha or Kulecha / Naan. Dam 
Ka Murgh. Different varieties of Qorma, Sada Qorma, Allu 
Ka  Qorma,  Kada  Qorma  and  Jahazi  Qorma  –  different 
kinds  of  daalchas,  do  Pyaazas  and  Qalias.  Worthy  of 
special  mention  is  Sarkari  Dalcha  consisting  of  different 
lentils and Maahi Qalia.

Among  deserts  many  Hyderabadi  preparations  are 
popular the world over today. A few typically Hyderabadi 
desserts,  deserve  to  be  mentioned.  Double  ka  meetha, 
seviyon  ka  muzafir,  maaquti,  sheerberanj  and  dum  ki 
puranpuri are just a handful of names from hundreds of 
rich  varieties  which  adorned  the  “Dastarkhaan”  of  old 
Hyderabad.

The  wealthy  and  leisured  aristocracy  of  the  erstwhile 
Nizam  State  as  well  as  the  long  peaceful  years  of  their 
dominance, contributed largely to the development of the 
Hyderabadi  Cuisine.  Their  devotion  to  the  culinary  art 
made it a princely legacy of the Nizam’s of Hyderabad.

Hyderabadi  cuisine  is  an  amalgamation  of  Mughlai, 
Turkish and Arabic cuisine with a healthy native influence. 
The  variety  of  ingredients  commonly  used  comprises 
mainly of rice, wheat, vegetables and meat. Mutton as well 
as chicken is used for special occasions. Skilled usage of 
various natural edibles, such as almonds, apricots, walnuts, 
cashew, coconut, peanut, sesame, poppy seeds and many 
spices like cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, caraway seeds, 
red  chilies,  turmeric,  cumin  seeds,  fenugreek,  pepper, 
coriander,  nutmeg,  bay  leaves,  fennel,  etc.  and  many 
beneficial herbs and flavors make this cuisine identical. It 
is slightly sour in taste, tomatoes and tamarind is used for 
the purpose.

A unique procedure of “Dum” is used; it is sealing the dish 
with dough and gently simmering its ingredients over slow 
fire to increase the absorption of the aromatic spices. Dum 
and barbecue are the techniques used for the preparation 
of mutton and chicken and the food is flavoured by the 
smoking process.

Mealtime  in  a  Hyderabadi  home  was  not  just  a  routine 
but  also  a  ritual,  a  time  for  celebration. A  meal  was  the 
grand finale and no guest could leave a Hyderabadi home 
without sharing a meal with the family.

Modern Hyderabadi cuisine evolved during the period of 
Nizam’s and elevated to a sublime art form. It is the result of 

many innovative technique and many new combinations 
tried  and  led  by  the  mastered  chef’s  (khansamas)  of 
the  royal  kitchen.  Most  of  the  modern  day  dishes  in 
Hyderabadi cuisine were introduced and invented during 
the times of Nizam’s and had become an integral part of 
the Hyderabadi food.

Shahi  Dastarkhan  was  the  dining  place  where  food  was 
served and eaten. “Chowki” - a low table was used instead 
of the dining table and cotton mattresses for squatting and 
bolsters for the backrest were used.

The  herbs  and  spices  used  in  the  dish  as  well  as  the 
method of preparation often give the dish its name. For 
formal  occasions  Hyderabadi  food  is  garnished  with 
“warq”, a very fine pure silver leaf created by prolonged 
hammering  and  flattening.  Some  of  the  dishes,  which 
make Hyderabadi cuisine distinct, are:

Dum  Biryani:  The  most  famous  meat  and  rice  dish, 
a  traditional  celebration  and  stairway  to  heaven.  An 
authentic Hyderabadi meal invariably includes biryani of 
mutton or chicken. Meat is stir fried with spices, marinated 
with curd and other spices for couple of hours and cooked 

with  basmati  rice  (the  best  quality  of  rice)  using  the 
procedure of “dum” (slow oven). Soaked saffron is used 
for its aroma and biryani is a must for feasts and festivals.

Mirch  ka  Salan:  It  is  served  along  with 
the Hyderabadi biryani. Coconut, peanut, 
sesame seeds along with some spices are 
used for the unique refreshing flavour.

Hyderabadi Haleem: It is a dish made with wheat, meat 
and pure ghee. Cooked for 
hours  to  get  the  porridge 
like  paste, 
it  has  high 
nutritive  value  because  of 
its contents, usually served 
to break the fast in Ramzan.

Hyderabadi  Marag:  A 
spicy meat soup, it is light 
in  texture  and  prepared 
with tender mutton. It is a 
perfect starter.

Hyderbadi Nahari Paya: It is prepared with sheep or goat 
trotters. Paste of nuts and spices are used, then garnished 
with rich cream and served hot with “naan” or “sheermaal” 
(soft special bread).

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiawomen  and  thus,  an  indigenous  Muslim  community 
consisting of those with Arab blood took root in Kerala. 
They were called Mapillah meaning Maha Pillai, meaning 
someone  held  in  high  esteem.  Mapillah  also  means 
bridegroom. The local converts too were identified by this 
name  and  today  roughly  20%  of  the  Kerala  population 
comprises of Muslims. 

Malabar cuisine is the synthesis of two culinary traditions. 
As in the case  of newborn where relatives of parents lay 
claim to this or the family likeness, it is tempting to carry 
out  a  culinary  DNA  matching  with  the  recipes  as  the 
genetic code. For E.g. the abundant use of coconut is clearly 
Malayali trait, but ghee (clarified butter) inveigles its way 
into Mapillah kitchen. The Arabs used it and they called it 
Samn. The sheep’s head curry and the whole stuffed sheep 
served at Mapillah weddings is also an Arab legacy. The 
belief that the food must surprise the eater is the raison d’ 
etre for many stuffed dishes in the Middle East. In one of 
the Mapillah recipes a hardboiled egg is stuffed in whole 
chicken, which is encased in a pillow of dough. The Love 
of layering – think of Turkish BAKLAVA and the Yemini 
BINT al SAHN is mirrored in the Mapillah desert called 
Chattipathiri.  So  when  you  look  at  the  Malabar  recipes 
there  are  overlaps  of  cultures  and  kitchen  beyond  the 
shores.

The  way  we  eat  reflects  the  way  we  live  and  Mapillah 
cuisine  embodies  this.  It  owes  its  uniqueness  to  certain 
foods  and  certain  attitudes  towards  food.  Fasting  and 
feasting are taken seriously. Ramadan, the 9th month of 
Lunar Calendar is dedicated to fasting and prayers. This is 
the time when Mapillah women turn their hands to snack 
making in a big way. Alisa – a wheat potage a common 
dish also eaten in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon is a Ramadan 
special dish. 

Dinner is meant to fortify the eater for the next day’s fasting. 
This is where the Pathiri rules. Pathiri is a unique Mapillah 
creation. For e.g. the Podi PathiriI the simplest one is made 
from rice flour and resembles the North Indian Chappati. 
It is a very thin griddle roasted circular bread. But Pathiri 
as a genre displays complexity and diversely not seen in 
the other breads. Besides rice flour, Pathiri can be made 
from rice batter, deep fried like poori, steamed, eaten with 
curry and can be a standalone dish also. All in all there are 
at least 500 different types of Pathiris.

Though  life  in  Malabar  is  changing,  the  matrilineal 
tradition  endures  especially  in  North  Malabar.  After 
marraige the women continues to live in her family house 
or tharavadu with her husband and children. Assured of 
a roof and financial security she did not have to go out to 

Mapillah Cuisine

Faiza Moosa

Kerala the Coastal State, 39863 sq km lying in the extreme 
South of India is a tropical paradise with the green of rice 
paddies,  banana  plantations,  coconut  palms,  the  blue  of 
rivers and teeming seas. It presents an astonishing array of 
foods; white rice and coconut are de rigueur in the Malayali 
menu. There are so many unusual ways of preparing them 
that your palate is constantly pleasured.

Here in Kerala we have three main cuisines. The Muslim, 

Christian  and  the  Hindu  Cuisine.  The  North  of  Kerala 
about 580km coastline is called by the name Malabar and 
the Muslims here are referred to as Mopillas or Mapillahs 
and the cuisine is called “Mapillah Cuisine”.

It is said, that within a generation of the prophet’s death 
Islam had reached Malabar. Arab Merchants from Aden, 
Yemen and Oman were the early conduits through which 
the faith reached Malabar. They made alliance with local

culinary skills. Cooking was a woman’s art. Recipes were 
heirlooms passed from mother to daughter through listen 
–watch and learn method. The Tharavadu kitchens were 
big and all the laborious task like grinding, grating and 
pounding were hired. 

In  Malabar  marriages  are  mostly  “arranged  marriages”. 
The  feasting  begins  several  days  before  marriage  and 
during this time the traditional cuisine is showcased in all 
its glory. The appetizers are numerous and elaborate. At 
certain times the bread make their entry in a procession of 
pathiris, flaky wheat porottas etc. along with a flotilla of 
meat and chicken dishes. 

Then  follows  the  Biryani  accompanied  by  date  pickle, 
coconut chutney and raita ( a yogurt based relish). Certain 
dishes are only connected with weddings. For e.g. Alisa-
the  wheat  potage  and  the  mutta  maala  (the  egg  yolk 

sweet).  Wherever  there  is  a  Muslim  community  there  is 
Biryani.  Besides  Mutton  and  Chicken  Biryani’s,  Malabar 
also has unusual seafood Biriyani like the Fish Biryani, the 
Prawn Biryani etc. Arab Cuisine too has seafood and rice 
combos. Given the fact that it was not Mughals, but the 
monsoon winds that introduced the faith to Malabar, one 
wonder if the Malabar Biryani was not a product of the 
same process of synthesis – foreign cooking styles married 
to local ingredients – that created the local cuisine.

Everyday Mapillah food is not rich, nor has been, subjected 
to much experimentation. In the cooking of fish, coconut 
oil is used. A specialty of Malabar is Kallummakkai (the 
green lipped mussel that is found along the coast) is eaten 
stuffed, curried or fried.

As everywhere, in Kerala religion and history serve at the 
tabletop too, but its character comes from the extraordinary 
generosity of the Mapillah spirit.

PHULKOPI KORAISHUTIR TORKARI

Bhojohori Manna
The saga of rural cuisine

Siddhartha Chatterjee

The story of Bengali food has an age-old history. As Bengal 
and Assam are in the Gangetic belt, rice cultivation was 
predominant  and  that  made  the  locals  consume  mainly 
rice (called Bhat or boiled rice). Abundance of water bodies 
& rivers caused ample supply of various fish-both big and 
small for the locals to consume. Thus Bengal and Bangalis 
were branded as consumers of fish curries and rice. To a 
large extent Kerala also shared the same phenomenon and 
in  both  places  fish  eating  culture  continues.  You  cannot 
stop a “bangali” from talking about fish every day. 

Later, the British influence brought in various forms of fish 
eating  habits  like  fried  fish,  prawn  cutlet,  fish  coverage 

(called kabiraji) mainly using river Bekti and tiger prawns. 
Thus, these two types of fish got international acceptance, 
which still continues to be a delight for foodies across the 
world.  The  Japanese  consumes  a  major  portion  of  tiger 
prawns  of  the  Sundarbans.  The  commoners  continued 
consuming  cheaper  river  &  pond  fish  and  made  local 
curries  (akin  to  fish  soup),  which  is  still  the  staple  diet. 
With  the  advent  of  scientific  methods  of  farming  fish, 
Andhra  Pradesh  &  Gujarat  became  large  producers  of 
Rohu and Katla fish, which they distributed all over the 
country bringing in a sea change in fish eating culture.

Till about fifteen years back Bengal and its capital Kolkata 

56

57

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiahardly had any good eating places serving Bengali cuisine. 
There  were  very  few  Bangladeshi  restaurants  on  Free 
School  street  thronged  by  the  Bangladeshi’s.  On  an  up 
market scale, Aheli (Peerless group) and Qeupies served 
Bengali cuisine and there were roadside joints also called 
“Bhater  Hotel”  but  they  lacked  quality  and  ambience. 
This is when Bhojohori Manna was created without much 
fan fare. It was the brainchild of five friends who had a 
common passion for food but with no experience in food 
business. Initially it was decided that few snacky items will 
be on the menu but that could not generate sales required 
to sustain any kind of business. Hence some rice, fish & 
vegetable  curries,  daal  and  of  course  chicken  &  mutton 
curries  were  introduced.  Cooking  was  done  exactly  the 
way  it  was  done  in  any  household.  People  passing  by 
tried  the  food  and  they  liked  it  possibly  because  it  was 
simple. The word spread around and the regular shoppers 
around South Kolkata shopping area dropped by in the 
afternoon and enjoyed the food. The little place (18 seaters) 
on Ekdalia road (South Kolkata) where Bhojohori Manna 
started, soon got clumsy with paucity of space leading to 
long  ques.  Consumer  demand  led  to  a  slow  conversion 
of  simple  home  style  cooking  into  a  slightly  more,  if  I 
am  permitted  to  say  “  masaledar  cooking”.  Demand 

matrix led to creation of other outlets in Kolkata to cater 
to  consumers  closer  to  their  area  of  convenience.  Today 
we have presence in almost all parts of Kolkata as well as 
North  Bengal  (Siliguri)  Puri  (Odisha),  Bengaluru  and  of 
course Mumbai.

The  cuisine  started  with  some  local  cooks  who  went 
through a trial run before the first restaurant was opened. 
They  did  not  have  the  knowledge,  which  normally  a 
trained  chef  would  have  but  were  great  with  cooking”. 
They  are  still  with  us  and  hence  Bhojohori  Manna  runs 
till today without chefs or as a matter of fact any trained 
persons  from  the  hotel  management  schools.  They  are 
sourced from villages and do not have formal degrees but 
are great in their “rustic wisdom”. In some way we have 
been indulging in CSR activities right from the first day 
and also created small time entrepreneurs (mostly village 
women)  who  are  supplying  us  semi-cooked  food.  From 
very  poor  conditions,  these  families  now  have  a  decent 
living.

For our readers, let me present a few Bengali dishes, which 
could  give  you  an  insight  into  good  dining  experience. 
Fish comes naturally at the top of the list.

58

ILISH BHAJA

Kolkata Bekti (pronounced by locals as Bhetki) comes in 
the form of a whole fish -weighing about 2-3 kg. The fish 
has one central bone, which if taken out creates a boneless 
fillet.  Depending  on  what  you  want  to  make  out  of  it, 
these fillets are cut to different sizes to suit different kind 
of preparations. Most popular would be crumb fried fish 
(Bhetki Rongpuri as named by us) which goes very well as 
a starter. The word “Rongpuri” has been coined because 
of the usage of “ajwain” during the course of marination 
along with onion & ginger paste. This use, we believe is an 

adaptation of culinary skills from “Rongpur”(presently in 
Bangladesh). This with a dash of “Kasundi” (the Bengali 
version of mustard sauce) is absolutely a delight for food 
lovers.

The same betki in another form of a starter called “Bhetki 
Paturi”  is  a  wonder  creation.  This  is  a  steamed  betki  in 
cube  form,  marinated  with  mustard  paste  and  wrapped 
in banana leaves and then charcoal baked. Paturi is akin 
to  “patrani  machhee”(a  Parsi  will  explain  you  in  more 

59

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiadetails). The paturi can also be made with shrimps (chingri 
paturi) or hilsa (ilish paturi).

Bhojohori officially has 55 items in their menu only with 
fish. Each one has its origin from rural Bengal adapted to 
suit  modern  taste  bud  but  keeping  original  recipes  and 
spices intact.

Another very interesting fish item is called “Muitha”, an 
adaption from the delicacies of Dhaka (Bangladesh). It is 
again boneless “fish cakes” prepared from giant sized fish 
called “Chitol”, best available in river Brahmaputra. One 
side of the fish, which has soft bones, is scraped out to take 
the meat out. The small bones are separated out and the 
meat is mixed with boiled potato, which acts as a binder. 

The  dough  created  is  then  made  into  chops  and  boiled, 
cooled and then cut into diamond shaped pieces, which is 
later lightly fried in oil. The curry is separately made using 
onion, ginger & garlic paste, turmeric powder etc. Once 
it is cooked, the cakes are put into the curry and served 
hot. It is one of the finest delicacies. A Bengali son- in -law 
would be offered “Muitha” whenever he is visiting his in-
laws, as it is a delicacy.

The most sought after fish are Tiger Prawns, Hilsa (queen 
of  fish)  and  Kolkata  can  boast  about  the  best  quality  of 
these in India.

For  the  vegetarians,  it  will  be  interesting  to  note  that 
around  45  varieties  of  vegetable  dishes  are  on  the 
menu almost every day at the Bhojohori Manna outlets. 
Interestingly,  there  is  a  huge  use  of  banana  items  in 
Bengali dishes. Almost all parts of a banana tree are eaten 
by Bengali’s. The flower, stem and raw banana itself also 
finds way into Mocha Paturi, Shukto, Kach kolar kofta etc. 
and can be simply delicious when eaten with steamed rice. 

60

Needless to mention, these delicacies are rich in iron and 
vitamin. Bengali’s use of “Posto”(poppy seeds) in various 
vegetarian  dishes  is  well  known.  This  particular  food  is 
adapted  from  the  district  of  Purulia,  which  is  situated 
in Western Bengal and is considered a dry place. Use of 
poppy seeds leads to drowsiness and incidentally, this is a 
banned food item in UAE.

Daal (pulses) is also very popular with a Bengali and in 
almost all cases the lunch or dinner starts with mixing daal 
and rice. Unlike the North Indian variety, Bengali daal is 
not thick and is similar to lentil soup. Moong, masoor and 
chana daals are the favourites. There is an extensive use 
of coriander leaves and in some cases coconut. Daal is a 
must in Bengali cuisine. For a detailed menu, log –www.

Large Corporations & MNCs over the years have tried to 
introduce  products  created  by  them  through  extensive 
research & development into the rural parts of India and 
have  been  successful  in  creating  a  mass  market.  Thus 
rural India is now used to biscuits & beverages of western 
origin. Bhojohori Manna on the other hand has adapted 
rural food and presented the same in its original form to 
the urban consumers, which is gaining acceptance by the 
day. We are still working on adapting more of the village 
cuisine,  employing  more  rural  people  and  present  their 
skills to the urban population. Our journey to show case 
Indian food will now enter the international community 
through our humble entry in Dubai.

Bhojohori Manna is grateful to the publishers for allowing 
us an entry to narrate the saga of rural food transformation 
into the urban stream.

Bihari Cuisine

Deepak Gupta

A  question  that  is  often  asked,  “Is  there  a  separate 
Cuisine? You mean Bihari food is different – not just dal 
and rice. The next obvious question asked - What is it? The 
knowledgeable associate it with Litti and Choka, which of 
course is the most popular Bihari dish.

Unfortunately  this  land  of  intellectuals,  great  masters, 
flourishing empires and the seat of learning- the Nalanda 
University is famous today for crime and corruption. The 

true  Bihar  with  its  amazingly  rich  culture,  history  and 
food is completely submerged having lost any reference to 
its glorious identity.

In small pockets of Bihar there are still remnants of what 
constituted  the  seat  of  great  spiritual  and  intellectual 
power. To understand the food of Bihar, it is imperative 
to understand the history and culture, as the cuisine is an 
outcome of the influences that people have been through, 

61

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiafoods  include  ghee,  lassi,  butter,  yogurt  known  as  dahi 
and buttermilk known as mattha. The importance of milk 
products,  particularly  amongst  the  Maithils,  is  reflected 
through an old quotation:

“  Aadi  Ghee  aur  Ant  Dahi,  oyi  Bhojan  k  Bhojan 
kahi” (A good meal, is a meal that starts with ghee 
and ends with yogurt).

Breakfast in Bihar is a heavy meal comprising of paratha, 
poories  ,  sabjee/  vegetables,  channa,  dhuchka,  bhabhra, 
chhanch- a savoury crepe made from lentils & rice.

The Bihari thaali, even today changes every 3 to 4 months, 
gracing it with seasonal fresh vegetable dishes. There are, 
however,  some  constants  such  as  rice,  roti,  vegetables, 
achar, chatni, dals and milk products with some variation. 
The non-vegetarians would add a fish or lamb in addition. 
A  brilliant  concept  the  thali,  is  popular  as  it  offers  a 
wide range of flavors for the food loving, Bihari palette. 
The  dishes  mirror  condiments  like  jeera  or  panchforan 
(“five  seeds”,  namely  saunf,  sarson,  methi,  ajwain  and 
mangraeel / Kalaunji) are sprinkled generously across the 
dishes and for “chhounkna”--”Tadka”(tempering) of some 
vegetables. Cooking oils opted for would be vegetable oil, 
mustard oil and loads of ghee.

The  Turks,  Mughals  and  Romans  also  left  their  mark, 
bringing in the kebabs, biryani and kofte. The play of the 
meats, chicken and fish with a sprinkling of traditional & 
local Indian spices took the Indian non-vegetarian cuisine 
to  a  different  order  of  taste.  Some  of  these  famous  food 
items include Biharee Kabab, Shami Kabab, Nargisi Kofte, 
Shabdeg,  Yakhnee  Biryanee,  Mutton  Biryani,  Shalgum 
Gosht, Baqer Khani, Kulcha, Naan, Roti, Seveyee Zarda, 
Qemamee Seveyia, Gajar ka Halwa and Andeka Zafrani 
Halwa  among  many  others.  This  was  mentioned  by 
Maulana  Abul  Kalam  Azad  in  his  memoirs  where  the 
distinctive flavour of Bihari non-vegetarian cooking finds 
a special mention.

One  very  interesting  dish  in  Bihar  is  called  Dal 
Pithee.  This  is  our  Pasta  in  a  Lentil  broth!  Wheat 
pasta  florets  are  hand  made,  cooked  in  dal  & 
tempered with ghee & jeera. It is eaten with a spicy 
garlic, potato & brinjal preparation.

Biharis are quite famous for their Bihari kebabs, which has 
a very distinctive flavour and is fried unlike other kebabs, 
which are pan fried or roasted. This dish was traditionally 
made from mutton and is eaten with roti, paratha or boiled 
rice. 

One of the most remarkable results of the vegetables being 
cooked is the turn out of “smoked food”. It refers to using 
smoked red chilli to infuse a strong aroma in food. It is 
the same chilli that is used for successfully warding away 
evil spirits, these Chilli’s are available in a regular Bihari 
Kitchen.

The region of Champaran was ruled in ancient India by 
Sirdhwaj Janak, an erudite scholar as well as the temporal 
and  spiritual  lord  for  his  subjects.  Yagyavalkya  was 
his  chief  priest  who  codified  the  Hindu  law  known  as 
Yajnavalkya Smriti. Proximity to Bengal and Nepal lead to 
a tussle of years, with the Mughals taking over at one point 

not  only  of  the  last  decades,  but  impact  of  centuries.  It 
will be apt to set some context of global influence that has 
shaped the cuisine of this region. 

Bihar’s  antiquity  is  evident  from  its  name,  which  is 
derived  from  the  ancient  word  ‘Vihara’  (monastery), 
which evolved to Bihar due to the local penchant for all 
V’s being converted to Bh’s to match the basic dialect. It 
is one of the oldest inhabited places in the world with a 
history of 3000 years. It is a land that is blessed with the 
footprint  of  the  Masters  themselves  and  subsequently 
abounds with Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist, Jains, and Sikh 
shrines. This ancient land also bespeaks of the world’s first 
major empires rise and fall. 

The  cultural  mix  and  food  adventure,  with  Bihar  at  the 
central point expanded as Ashoka expanded his empire. 
The range of global impact was visible during the Mauryan 
Empire, when Ashoka, towered over nearly the entire sub-
continent and scholars like Megasthenes from Greece, Fa 
Hien and Hiuen Tsang from the east, traversed through 

the land and left their mark on the cuisine.

As  the  flow  of  the  Greeks,  Roman  Japanese,  Burmese, 
Cambodian,  Afghanis’,  Moghuls  and  British  flowed 
through Bihar, the cuisine and taste for alternative options 
evolved to a point that the pasta merged with dal in the same 
dish!  On  the  other  hand  some  pure  delicacies  remained 
as  the  royalty  and  generals  demanded  their  favourites. 
This lead to the local Bihari’s evolving their palette with 
no  less  than  crepes,  pasta,  dim  sums,  elaborate  kebabs, 
along with the bar-be-que or fried Litti’s. Yes, where there 
is prosperity the sweet tooth will be eclectic and the range 
of desserts evolved to be exotic and exciting. 

Lord  Buddha  attained  his  enlightenment  in  Bodhgaya, 
which  is  currently  the  ultimate  pilgrimage  point  for 
devotees and tourists. The impact of religion is significant 
of  the  region  and  the  Bihari  cuisine  is  predominantly 
vegetarian.  Vegetarian  diet  leans  over  to  compensate 
through  dairy  products,  which  are  a  part  and  parcel  of 
the  local  household,  throughout  the  year.  The  common

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaThe Bihari meal whether vegetarian or non-vegetarian is 
trimmed with accessories. These can be crisps made out 
of lentils, poshto, sago, innumerable chutneys, papads – 
roasted/  fried  or  pickles.  What  makes  this  interesting  is 
the combinations that emerge – rice and dal with mango 
pickle and a handful of salted bhujia thrown in and mixed 
or some rice, coriander chutney and onions topped with 
ghee. 

Festivals and events like marriages are a big deal - Chhath 
Puja, Teej, Durga Puja, Kali Puja and Diwali. Chhath Pooja 
is one of the major festivals of Bihar, when devotees of Sun 
God fast. On the last day of the festival, the fast is broken 
by  consuming  the  Chhath  prasad.  Sweets  like  Kheer, 
Thekua [wheat cookies] & fruits are offered as prasad to 
the sun god by the river bank.

Thekua- a wheat home made cookie is quite easy to make:
500 gms whole-wheat flour
300 gms Gur (Jaggery)
4-5 green cardamom - peeled and mashed
Ghee (or Vegetable Oil)
1.5-cup of water

Make a mix of jaggery, water and green cardamom. Add 4 
tbsp ghee to the jaggery syrup prepared above and mix it 
to the flour and make a hard dough out of it.

Take a small piece of the dough, press it flat against your 
palm  and  then  press  it  on  a  cookie  mold  for  making 
thekua. Once the thekua has acquired the imprint of the 
mold, deep fry it in ghee till it gets reddish brown. Filter 
out the ghee and put them aside. Allow the thekuas to cool 
down and serve.

Bihar  offers  a  large  variety  of  sweet  delicacies,  which 
unlike  those  from  Bengal,  are  mostly  dry.  Worthy  of 

special  mention  are  Tilkut,  Khaja  from  Silao,  Peda  from 
Deogarh  and  Anarsa  from  Gaya  for  their  popularity. 
Another  interesting  desert  is  Khubi  Ka  Lai,  born  of  the 
Ganges every year when it floods. A special kind of weed 
covers  the  banks  and  the  seeds  are  extracted  from  this 
abundant weed. These are roasted, de-seeded and small 
fluffy tasteless minute popcorns come out of these black 
seeds.  These  are  then  mixed  with  Khoya  and  nuts  and 
made into white round balls called Khubi Ka Lai. 

The  Bihar  Cuisine  would  remain  incomplete  without 
a  reference  of  Paan  (betel  leaves).  Bihar  truly  thrives  on 
paan. It may have begun due to its antiseptic properties 
that freshen the breath and acts as a digestive. However, 
today  it  is  like  most  foods  taken  for  its  taste.  The  first 
reference of the paan is as early as two thousand years ago, 
in a book ‘Mahawamsa’ of Srilanka. The Vedas too refer to 
paan being the first offering to the guru ensuring its sacred 
and veneered status. 

This respectful status is further confirmed by an old Bihari 
saying Paan, Maach and Makhana (betel leaves, fish and 
lotus seed) is not even found in paradise, implying- enjoy 
what you have now on earth and not regret it later!

and then final fame came when Champaran became the 
integral part of the Indigo revolt known as the Champaran 
Satyagraha.  This  land  named  after  the  Magnolia  tree 
boasts today of a famous mutton dish called taash. Taash 
is a classic combination dish that is made by frying mutton 
but eaten with Chewra, The taash inside a parantha, gets 
promoted to be called a Bihari roll making it an odd but 
very appetizing dinner.

This Sub Himalayan tribal region in the North has a unique 
style & repertoire impacted by the tribal & the rivers. The 
Sone, Gandak and the Ganges, supplied an endless supply 
of  fishes  like  Rohu,  Katla  –  a  variety  of  carp,  Singhara, 
variety  of  cat  fish,  fresh  water  prawns,  crabs  and  small 
fishes.  As  eons  of  cultures  passed  by,  fish  recipes  were 
exchanged  and  changed  over  thousands  of  years,  with 
the fish curry cooked in mustard paste with rice (maaach-
bhaat) triumphing to this date. The villages and towns by 
the rivers lean towards fish with their preferred food being 
Macha Jhor famous in Mithila as well. While fried fish is 
popular, the Kekra Chokha prefers to be roasted and then 

mashed to prepare a crab (Kankor) dish. 

Bihari  food  would  not  be  complete  without  mentioning 
Pittha  a  special  food  of  the Anga  region.  This  is  Bihar’s 
answer to the dim sums of the East. I would guess that the 
Buddhist & the scholars of the East left some impact on 
this style of cooking. It is a unique dish prepared from rice 
flour stuffed with savory chana dal, It is then steamed / 
cooked in boiling water. Pittha can be made stuffed (sweet 
or salty) or unstuffed. It is then sautéed in ghee and jeera 
with salt & black pepper.

Litti  Choka  is  synonymous  to  Bihar  &  has  global 
recognition.  Sattu  is  mixed  with  onions,  garlic,  ajwain, 
kala jeera, and pickle. This is then stuffed in wheat dough, 
which  is  salted  and  flavored  with  ajwain  &  laced  with 
ghee. This is roasted on slow heat & served with potato or 
vegetable mash like hash-browns. This style of cooking & 
food is found in Rajasthan & even Australian Aboriginals 
have something similar.

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiawere called “Dhabas”. They served home style meals to 
the travellers. The menu was a simple Dal and a seasonal 
vegetable,  served  with  fresh  green  chillies  and  onions, 
accompanied with tandoori roti. The food was served on 
a  Manji  (string  cots)  with  a  wooden  plank  in  the  centre 
that served as a table, after a hearty meal the plank was 
removed and the weary traveller could sleep on the same 
cot. 

The Dhaba were responsible for spreading Punjabi cuisine 
throughout India. Today the daal makhni , palak paneer 
and tandoori roti are standard items on the menu in all 
restaurants  serving  Indian  food  anywhere  in  the  world. 
Some 5 star hotels have restaurants called ‘Dhaba” in their 
hotels. 

The  earliest  references  to  region’s  food  are  found  in  the 
Vedas, which documents the lives of the Aryans in Punjab. 
Amazingly the elements mentioned over 6,000 years ago 
are still extant in this cuisine. This includes dairy-i (milk), 
ghrit  (ghee),  dadhi  (curd),  shak  (leafy  green  vegetables) 
and  a  variety  of  lentils  and  grain.  Even  today,  these  are 
the staple in Punjab the unhusked mash is the mother of 
all lentils. Rajmah derives from the word raj mash or the 
regal mash. 

Punjab-this  side  of  the  border  or  that-is  situated  at  the 
crossroads  of  the  Silk  Route.  Caravans  of  goods  and 
food stuff have arrived in Punjab since Harappan times . 
Proximity with Persia, Afghanistan and China and Central 
Asia, has had a huge influence on the eating habits of the 
Punjabis. It gave them a taste for rice, fresh and dried fruits 
and  exotic  nuts.  It  is  said  that    Kabuli  or  large  Channa 
reached  Punjab  with  Alexander  the  Great’s  troops  who 
came to Punjab via Afghanistan. 

Amritsar,  which  was  the  commercial  capital  of  North 
India prior to partition, had traders from the entire Central 

Asia frequent its bazaars . As these traders did not have 
homes in Amritsar they were forced to eat out and several 
eateries opened in the city which specialised in catering to 
a variety of palates. Even today it retains its reputation as 
the gourmet capital of India.  

The most recent influence on Punjabi cuisine was that of 
the Mughals who brought with them the tradition of the 
great  tandoor  ,  ghost  (  mutton/  lamb  )  rice  pillao,  musk 
melons  ,  saffron,  anardana,  (dried  pomegranate  seed  ) 
khas, ( poppy seed ) , gulab sharbat and a host of other 
foods  and  flavours.  They  converted  the  simple  Punjabi 
fare to a sophisticated cuisine, considered one of the best in 
the world today. The British brought apples and potatoes 
and began their cultivation in hills of Kulu district.. The 
Punjabis continue to add foreign elements to their food. 
Button  mushrooms  being  the  latest  to  show  up  on  the 
menu, these were introduced to Punjab in the early 70s. 

Punjabis lay great emphasis on Dairy produce. Cow milk 
is  used  for  drinking  and  buffalo  milk  is  used  to  make 
dahi (yogurt), which when churned is made into chaach 
(buttermilk)  and  makhan  (white  butter),  which  when 
heated  is  made  into  ghee  (clarified  butter).  Milk  is  also 
split to make a cheese called paneer. When the whole milk 
is cooked slowly the top surface forms a thick skin which 
is harvested to be used as cream ( malai).

Punjabi food revolves around milk products, no meal is 
complete without their generous use. Warm cow milk is 
usually had at night before bed. Dahi and chaach are had 
daily at lunch. Dahi is often whipped into a raita by adding 
salt,  cucumber,  mint,  onions  or  any  other  combination. 
Dahi is also used to make creamy sauces such as Kormas 
and Kadi. Paneer is cooked in gravies and sauces and is a 
key part of the daily menu. Gobs of makhan are used to 
top breads ( roti ) or dals and saags to enhance the flavour. 
Ghee is used as primary cooking –fat or shortening. Malai

Where Food is Loved and Shared 

Punjabi Cuisine 

Geetika Kalha

“Punjabi Dhaba” or “Sher- e- Punjab” road side eateries 
can  be  seen  throughout  the  country.  This  is  the  most, 
recognised and trusted brand in India. It stands for good, 
fresh, hot, vegetarian food served with warmth and gusto. 
The  Dhaba  has  made  “Punjabi  food”  synonymous  with 
“Indian  food”.  Every  restaurant  in  the  country  serves 
Punjabi food. 

It all began with the partition of India in 1947. One of the 
most  lucrative  and  easily  available  occupations  for  the 
Punjabi refugees was that of a driver – of trucks and taxis. 
This  required  them  to  travel  throughout  the  country  on 
very  low  budgets.  Seeing  a  business  opportunity  other 
Punjabi  refugees  opened  roadside  eateries  to  carter  to 
the need for rest and food of these drivers. These eateries

The famous dal makhaani contains generous amounts of 
ghee, butter and cream. 

(Indian gooseberry), apples and ginger are also made into 
delicious  preserves.  .  Black  carrots  are  fermented  with 
water to make the very unique Punjabi drink called kanji. 

Wheat is Punjab’s staple grain, it is ground finely to make 
Atta or flour. It is made into un-leavened bread (roti) on 
top of a griddle or tava and eaten daily with meals. The 
roti is often stuffed with mashed vegetables then basted 
and  fried  to  make  the  famous  Punjabi  parathas.  Atta  is 
also deep fried into puris and bhaturas eaten mostly for 
breakfast with a potato or chickpeas curry. When cooked 
in a tandoor the atta is made into naans, tandoori rotis and 
kulchas. In winter makki roti or corn bread is eaten with 
saag ( mustard leaves puree) 

Rice is very popular in Punjab, but unlike the rest of India it 
is never eaten plain boiled. In Punjab rice is always served 
tempered with cumin seeds, caramelised onions and other 
spices. It is often eaten as pillao made with mutton, peas, 
or the outstanding gucchi (morrel). On special occasions 
the  sweet,  spice  and  saffron  rice  loaded  with  dry  fruit  
(meethe chawal ) is usually the star attraction. 

The  traditional  fuel  for  cooking  in  Punjab  is  cow  dung 
cakes (paathis). This provides low heat allowing the food 
to cook slowly; it also adds a smoked flavour to the food 
which enhances the taste. The paathis are used in chullas ( 
stoves ) made of brick and clay.

The tandoor arrived in Punjab with  the Afghans during 
the  Sultanate  period.  In  the  Mughul  period  it  became 
a standard fixture in the kitchens of the aristocracy. The 
tandoor is not part of any Punjabi kitchen, but a common 
tandoor  was  often  found  in  Muslim  villages  where  the 
ladies would bring the atta and get their (roti ) bread made 
for  a  small  payment.  This  tradition  died  out  with  the 
partition of India. The tandoor is now used in restaurants 
or whenever there is need to carter to a large number of 
people. The tandooria is skilled in making naan, kulchas, 
roti,  roast  eggplants,  legs  of  mutton  and  chicken.  it  is  a 
highly sought after skill.

The  most  popular  beans  in  Punjab  are  mah  dal  (  black 
matpe) , rajmah ( red kidney bean), channa dal (split small 
chickpea),  kabuli  cholay  (large  chickpea),  rongi  (  black 
eyed beans ) and moog dal. Whole beans are soaked for 
a while, often overnight and then cooked in water on low 
flame for a few hours till the mixture becomes creamy. It is 
then tempered with caramelized onions, tomatoes, garlic, 
ginger and garam masala and other spices. 

Some of the iconic dishes which are exclusive to Punjab 
are  :  makki  ki  roti  and  sarson  da  saag,  pindi  chole  and 
bhature, rajmah and jeera chawal, aloo parantha or gobi 
parantha  served  with  curds,  poori  chaane  with  lassi  ( 
sweetened  butter  milk),  tandoori  roti  and  dal  makhani, 
tandoori chicken, butter chicken, kulcha chana, kanji, dahi 
wale ladoo, wadi chawal, matter paneer, palka paneer, rau 
di kheer and meethe chawal.

Irrigated  by  five  rivers,  a  large  variety  of  fruits  and 
vegetables are grown throughout the year and form part 
of Punjabi cuisine. Punjab consumes a variety of pickles 
and  preserves.  Famous  are  the  mango  pickle,  the  black 
lemon  pickle,  the  gobi  shalgam  (cauliflower  and  turnip) 
pickle,  galgal  (hill  lemon)  and  ginger  pickle.  Carrot 
preserves (murabba) are a must have winter dessert, amla 

The Punjabi’s believe that a mother’s love can be tasted in 
the “churi” she makes for her children. Churi is a small roti 
on which 3 or 4 heaped tablespoons of powered jaggery 
(shakkar), with a generous amount of ghee is added and 
all three are then kneaded together with finger tips and 
lots  of  love,  to  make  the  sweetest  simplest  dessert.  In 
Punjab a good wish is often responded to by saying “tere

ghee and shakkar).

Food  is  the  most  important  part  of  all  celebrations  in 
Punjab, be it weddings or festivals. Festival food is often 
different  from  the  daily  fare.  In  the  peak  of  winter  the 
festival  of  Lohri  is  marked  with  much  joy  and  singing 
around huge bon fires. This festival is celebrated to thank 
God  for  surviving  the  winter  and  to  seek  blessing  for  a 
good harvest. Special food such as gajak, reyvari, peanuts 
with jaggery, puffed rice and sesame seeds are made on 
this  occasion.  These  are  all  first  offered  to  the  fire  with 
prayers and then served to family and friends. A special 
desert is made during this festival – rau di kheer (sugar 
cane juice rice pudding).

The festival of Baisakhi marks start of the new year (desi 
year, is named after king Vikramaditya and starts in 57 B.C  
is celebrated with anaarse – small round pancakes made 
of rice flour, sugar, milk , deep fried and garnished with 
poppy seeds.

70

The festival of Basant Panchmani celebrates the onset of 
spring. The pleasant weather brings out the kite lovers and 
the sky is filled with multi coloured kites battling to cut the 
other’s kite string. While the men indulge in aerial sorties, 
the women dress in yellow and prepare yellow coloured 
food such as, saffron rice, biryani and jalaibees. Festivals 
give Punjabi’s an excuse to indulge in their favourite sport 
– eating. 

No discussion on Punjabi cuisine can be complete without 
the  mention  of  “  Langar”.  In  Persian  the  word  langar 
means – ‘an alms house’ or a shelter for the poor and needy. 
In the 12th and 13th century AD, it referred to a kitchen 
attached to Sufi centres or Dargha, which fed all those who 
visited there. In Punjab this tradition was started by the 
Sikh Gurus and is now an essential to the concept of Seva 
(service)  in  Sikhism.  Guru-  Ka-  Langar  is  a  community 
kitchen run in the name of the Guru, it is usually attached 
to  Gurudwaras  all  over  the  world.  The  ingredients  are 
brought  and  cooked  by  volunteers  who  recite  prayers 
while  preparing  the  food.  When  preparing  and  serving 
the food, strict standards of hygiene are maintained. The 
meal  consists  of  dal  without  tempering  and  roti  (called 
parshadas), some langars add a vegetable to the menu on 
special occasions. The sangat (community) sits on the floor 
in lines and eat together; there is no distinction of class or 
caste. No food is allowed to be wasted, everyone finishes 
their food and cleans there thalis (plates) before leaving. 

In  the  20th  and  21st  century  the  Sikhs  have  taken  the 
langar to all places where humanitarian relief is required. 
Be it earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons or train disasters, 
they are the first to set up a langar and start feeding the 
traumatised disaster hit community. 

The langar is a true reflection of Punjabi cuisine. In Punjab 
food is wholesome, it is loved and it is shared. 

Traditional Cuisines of Tamil Nadu

M.G. Devasahayam, HART Ambassador, Tamil Nadu

For  centuries  Tamil  Nadu  has  been  dominated  by  the 
Dravidian  culture.  The  cuisine  of  Tamils  therefore  is 
distinctly  different  from  that  of  the  north,  which  is 
primarily wheat-based. The classic foods of Tamil Nadu 
center around rice and lentils with liberal use of coconut. 
Though  equally  balanced  between  vegetarian  and  non-
vegetarian  delicacies,  Tamil  food  is  better  known  for  its 
mouth-watering  and  piping  hot  idlis  and  dosas,  which 
have  now  become  all-India  favourites  and  popular  in 
many  parts  of  the  world.  Both  these  are  made  from  a 
fermented batter of ground rice and lentils. For idli, the 
batter is steamed into small puffy disks while dosa batter is 
spread thinly on a griddle and cooked into a crispy crepe/
pancake type of a dish. Both dishes are traditionally eaten 
with coconut chutney and sambar, a thick soup of lentils, 
tamarind and vegetables. These are pure vegetarian.

A  Tamil  meal  is  traditionally  served  on  a  banana  leaf, 
with  each  dish  placed  in  a  particular  spot  on  the  leaf 

and designed to be eaten in a certain order, with specific 
combinations of the dishes mixed together with the fingers.

Before eating, a small portion of each food is set aside in 
the upper corner as an offering to God. Meals are taken 
seated on the floor, and traditionally, the host continuously 
replenishes any food that is finished until the diner folds 
his or her leaf in half. This tradition is fast vanishing. 

The best Tamil food is prepared at home by women who 
have learned the secrets of every dish and spice mixture 
from generations of mothers and mothers-in-law. Amma 
in Tamil means mother and even the most highly trained 
chefs  can’t  quite  duplicate  the  complex  mixture  of 
knowledge and love that an Indian Amma puts into her 
meals. 

Though  varieties  of  Tamil  vegetarian  food  are  spread 
throughout  the  state  with  its  flavour  spreading  to 
neighbouring  Kerala,  Karnataka  and  Andhra  Pradesh, 
the most popular cuisines are invariably non-vegetarian. 
Among these the, Chettinad cuisine takes place of primacy 
though  there  exist  equally  traditional  and  delicious 
cuisines- Kongunad and Nanjilnad. 

Seafaring	Chettinad	cuisine
The famous Chettinad cuisine is the traditional food of the 
banking  and  merchant  Chettiyar  community  who  made 
the areas of Ramnad, Karaikudi and Madurai their home 
centuries  ago.  Returning  from  their  travels  abroad,  the 
Chettiyars brought back home with them the flavours of 
the Far East, from as far as Burma. 

71

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaNo Chettinad meal is complete without meat, especially 
chicken,  lamb  and  prawns.  These  meats  are  marinated 
in masalas ground by hand to create aromatic and spicy 
dishes. Chettinad cuisine is replete with dried meats, kept 
in  the  sun  to  tide  over  the  harsh  dry  summer  months. 
These dried meats are then cooked gingerly with oil and 
doused  with  masalas  comprising  precise  amounts  of 
aniseed, fennel, cumin, pepper, cinnamon and cloves. 

popular dishes being Vazhaipoo Vadai (deep fried lentil 
balls with banana flower), Makka Chola Vadai (deep fried 
lentil balls with corn), Kongu Kaalan Varuval (mushroom 
fry),  Pallipalayam  Paalkatti  Varuval  (similar  to  panneer 
fry),  Kongu  Thakkali  Rasam  (tomato  soup),  Murungai 
Keerai Rasam (soup made with leaves of drumstick tree) 
and Pollachi Thengai Kuzhambu (golden brown coconut 
gravy cooked with badam nuts). 

“Chettinad food has a lot more meat in it than the Nanjilnad 
and  the  Kongunad  cuisines,”  says  culinary  expert  Jafar 
Sadiq. “The key is in the use of spices as far as Chettinad 
food is concerned,” he adds. 

Beyond	Chettinad…
Tamil Nadu is a multitude of geographical distinctions, as 
far as culinary expertise and tradition goes. As the coast 
and the hills exist side by side, their food too intermingles 
in  a  heady  aromatic  blend  that  leaves  the  food  lover 
gasping  for  more.  Chicken  Chettinad  might  well  be  the 
hot  favourite  in  restaurants  across  the  state  but  Tamil 
Nadu’s cuisines are not just about the Karaikudi variety 
of spicy, tangy masala-filled aromatic dishes. The foothills 
of the Western Ghats in the state as well as the southern 
shores lapped by the lazy waves of the Arabian Sea too 
have distinct cuisines of their own. These two regions are 
not known for usage of too much spice. The influence of 
Kerala is evident, as both of these regions fall along the 
border of the neighbouring coastal state. Welcome to the 
lesser known, but equally delightful cuisines of Kongunad 
and Nanjilnad. 

Kongunad –Food of the Western Ghats
Kongunad  refers  to  the  area  along  the  western  regions 
of  Tamil  Nadu  –  the  areas  surrounding  Coimbatore, 
Kangayam,  Tirupur,  Pollachi,  Salem,  Erode  and 
Namakkal.  The  soft-spoken  Kongus  make  a  variety 
of  dishes  equally  soft  on  the  palate.  Some  of  the  most 

Kongu  food  is  synonymous  to  the  coconut.  Most  dishes 
in Kongunad cuisine have coconut in some form – be it 
roasted and made into paste or freshly grated coconut or 
even coconut milk. Sesame seeds, groundnut and roasted 
turmeric  are  essential  ingredients  of  the  Kongu  kitchen. 
These are then stirred together with coconut oil and fresh 
chicken or lamb to create mildly spiced, aromatic dishes 
that are easy to eat and digest. 

Unlike  the  Chettinad  version  of  dishes,  Kongu  cuisine 
uses only fresh meat. No marination is done beforehand 
and dried meats are seldom used. This brings a heady and 
fresh taste to the various dishes cooked in the western belt 
of Tamil Nadu. 

“Kongunad cuisine is milder, more nutritious and they use 
a variety of locally grown cereals like millets, ragi, black 
gram and horse gram.” says culinary expert Jafar Sadiq, 
Managing Partner at Jacob’s Kitchen, a popular chain of 
restaurants in Tamil Nadu which serves up delectable, little 
known Tamil fare. Sadiq and his late partner Jacob Sahaya 
Kumar  traveled  and  researched  little  known  traditional 
cuisines  of  Tamil  Nadu  for  14  long  years.  “Chicken  and 
mutton are more popular since the area is not very close 
to the sea.” 

Kongunad cuisine is also a reminder of the historic foods 
of  the  Tamils  of  western  Tamil  Nadu.  Millets  are  used 
extensively, giving a flavour of the earth at the foothills of 
the Western Ghats. Tamarind too is used liberally, an anti-

72

oxidant, that grows in abundance in the area. A plethora of 
pulses and cereals are used in almost every signature dish 
of  the  Kongunad  region.  Cashew  nuts  and  almonds  are 
soaked and ground into creamy paste, forming the base 
for thick delectable gravies that are eaten with millets and 
coarse rice. 

A  specialty  of  the  region  is  the  Navathania  Soup  (soup 
made  of  nine  grains).  This  combines  millets,  corn,  ragi, 
wheat,  black  gram,  horse  gram,  green  gram,  chana  dal, 
field beans, pepper, coriander and curry leaves to bring a 
tasty and healthy soup to the table. 

Kongu desserts are an absolute treat to the foodie. Local 
ingredients  are  used  innovatively  to  create  sweets  that 
simply melt in the mouth. Palmyra and coconut form the 
base for many sweets exclusive to the Kongu region of the 
state. It is impossible to resist the Pathaneer halwa (sweet 
dish made of palm fruit juice) and Elaneer Payasam (sweet 
kheer  made  of  tender  coconut)  which  are  a  couple  of 
famous and mouth watering specialties of the Kongu belt. 

However, if you are a vegetarian, do not fret. The Kongu 
region  grows  and  supplies  fresh  vegetables  to  the  rest 
of the state as well as to neighbouring states. Fresh leafy 
greens,  mushrooms,  corn  and  carrots  are  locally  grown 
and when added to the famous cashew based gravy of the 
region, bring out the bursting flavour of the land. 

Cuisine  of  Nanjilnad,  the  Land’s  End  of 
India 
While the most popularised variety of Tamil food is indeed 
the Chettinad style, the Nanjilnad cuisine is distinct for its 
taste  and  its  breadth  of  dishes.  Populated  by  the  Nadar 
and  fisher-folk  communities,  Kanyakumari  region’s 
proximity to neighbouring Kerala has brought in a taste of 
the western coast in its food as well. 

The people of this region speak both Tamil and Malayalam 

fluently. Their lifestyles too are shared, with hard work and 
excellent education being the hallmark of the Kanyakumari 
native. Fishermen head out to fish in the Arabian Sea at 
daybreak and at nightfall, they return with fresh catch of 
tuna,  salmon,  sardine  and  the  locally  beloved  pomfret. 
Fish is the staple here and residents of Kanyakumari add 
seafood to almost every gravy and dish in their menu. 

Coconut too is another staple, like in the Kongunad cuisine. 
The gentle swaying of coconut and palm trees of Nanjil 
landscape  forms  the  perfect  setting  for  a  mildly  spiced, 
nutritious  food,  rich  in  protein  and  fibre.  Ginger,  green 
chillies  and  garlic  bring  out  the  fresh  flavours of  locally 
available ingredients, creating heady concoctions hard for 
the food connoisseur to resist. “Since the Nanjilnad food is 
heavily influenced by Kerala, the taste is mild and lots of 
vegetables are added along with fish in the food,” explains 
Sadiq. 

These  dishes  of  fish  and  coconut  are  accompanied  by 
the Kerala variety of rice. This rice is thicker and harder 
in  texture  than  the  traditional  rice  of  Tamil  Nadu.  This 
reddish  brown  rice  is  steamed  in  water  and  the  starchy 
broth left behind is consumed as an accompaniment to the 
meal. Beef is eaten in these areas, another influence of the 
neighbouring state of Kerala. 

The  Ulunthuchoru  (rice  and  black  lentils)  is  not  to  be 
missed when you head to the coasts of Kanyakumari. This 
is one of the traditional Nanjilnad dishes and is served in 
accompaniment with Varuthu Araicha Thovaiyal (roasted 
coconut chutney). Aviyal (stew) made with egg and fresh 
vegetables as well as Kerala’s famous Pappadam (papad) 
add to the high protein value of the tasty meal. 

A  speciality  of  this  region  is  the  variety  of  tapioca,  rich 
in  carbohydrates  which  can  double  as  staple  food  and 
sweet-dish and is good for making chips. Tapioca pearls 
are  referred  to  as  “Javvarisi”  in  Tamil  and  most  of  the 

73

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiadelicacies are cooked from this form of tapioca. During the 
famine  of  the  fifties  the  poor  in  this  region  survived  on 
tapioca as staple food.

One  of  the  few  spicy  stews  in  the  Nanjilnad  cuisine  is 
the Vendhaya Kuzhambu. Made of fenugreek, this thick 
aromatic  stew  is  spicy  and  perfect  with  Ulunthuchoru, 
the preparation of rice and black lentils. Theeyal is also a 
trademark dish of this cuisine, consisting of vegetables in 
burnt gravy. 

In the desserts department, Nanjil cuisine outdoes itself. 
Try  the  Kinnathappam,  a  traditional  dessert  literally 
meaning  ‘plate  cake’,  a  signature  dish  that  natives  of 
Nagercoil  love.  Made  of  white  rice  and  coconut  milk, 
kinnathappam  bursts  with  nutrition  and  carbohydrates. 
Its  cousin  is  the  Elayappam,  literally  translating  to  ‘leaf 
cake’. A mixture of rice flour, coconut, jiggery and spices 
are wrapped tightly in plantain leaves and steamed. Other 
festival  delicacies  are  crisp  and  crunchy Achu  Murukku 
and Mundhiri Kothu made of rice-paste, lentil and jaggery 
combination.

In sum, as is their language and culture, food of the Tamils 
is also ancient and rich. As they say ‘variety is the spice of 
life’. Tamil Nadu lives it to the full in its mind-boggling, 
spicy  and  mouth-watering  cuisine  of  main  dishes,  side-
dishes and desserts. These are to be tasted to be believed. 
Herewith  are  visuals  of  some  select  dishes  across  the 
cuisine:

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiaarchaeologists  and  now  housed  in  museums  possess 
immense heritage value. Made of clay, metal, alloys and 
also stone, they were used in the preparation of cuisines 
during the reigns of prominent empires and dynasties and 
reveal interesting details of the blending of that period’s 
culinary  habits,  agricultural  production,  economy  and 
infrastructural progress.

Excavations at the Indus Valley, one of the oldest and at 
that  time  a  highly  developed  civilization  in  the  world 
indicate that around 1500 B.C. the Aryans entered India. 
Over the ages, India witnessed the rise and fall of several 
empires - the Mauryas, the Guptas, the Slave dynasty, the 
Mughals and Sikh rulers of the North, the Marathas of the 
West and the Cholas, Pandyas and Cheras in the South. 

Starting  from  the  15th  century  onwards  ships  carrying 
Portuguese,  British,  French  and  Dutch  traders  started 
arriving  in  India.  The  British  later  colonized  and  ruled 
over India for about 200 years till 1947 when India gained 
Independence. 

Tracing  cooking  utensils  with  heritage  value  would 
necessitate  tracing  their  origins.  The  Bronze  Age  on 
the  Indian  subcontinent  began  with  the  Indus  Valley 
civilization.  Inhabitants  of  Mohenjo-Daro  and  Harappa 
developed techniques in metallurgy and produced copper, 
lead,  bronze  and  tin.  Artisans  produced  a  wide  range 
of  utilitarian  and  decorative  objects  using  specialized 
techniques  of  stonework,  ceramics  and  metallurgy. 
Copper, bronze and shell were used to make utensils. 

Wheat and barley were 
the  main  food  crops 
grown  by  the  Indus 
valley 
farmers.  Peas 
and  dates  were  also 
grown.  Cattle,  goats, 
sheep  provided  milk 
Brass pot of the Indus Valley civilization
and  meat.  Food  was 
cooked  on  hearths  and  grain  was  ground  to  flour  by 
rubbing a rounded stone across on top of a flat stone. Bread 
and porridge were part of everybody’s diet. Commoners 
thrived on vegetables and fish and the rich ate poultry and 
game.

During  what  is  called  the  Golden  Age  of  India,  that  is, 
the  Mauryan  and  Gupta  Empires,  during  the  320-550 
BC, pots and pans recovered from that period reveal that 
a high degree of skill and perfection was reached in the 
preparation of clay utensils, which were popular in daily 
domestic use. Influences of Buddhism, Jainism and later 
Islam  affected  food  habits  of  the  people.  Even  the  rock 
edicts of Ashoka supported the benefits of vegetarianism 
but the utensils in, which they were prepared, were not 
mentioned.

From  the  Mauryan  Empire  to  the  frequent  invasions  by 
Turco-Mongolian marauders into the country from around 
the 10-11th centuries and prior to the establishment of the 
Mughal Empire, Vasco Da Gama arrived in India in 1498 
leading to colonization of parts of India by the Portuguese. 
As with other cuisines, Indian cuisine absorbed the new-
world vegetables such as tomatoes, chilies’ and potatoes. 

Pottery  or  ceramic  ware  of  the  era  was  heavy  and  fine 
clay was used in making smooth surfaced vessels which 
were then painted in black over red. Coarse grey ware was 
meant for rough use such as cooking. The surface of the 
vessels was rough, coarse grey and decorated with incised 
designs. 

The  Mughals  (1526-1857)  introduced  Mughlai  cuisine  to 
India, the influence of, which spread from Kashmir and 
Awadh  in  the  North  to  Hyderabad  far  down  in  South 
India. The cuisine was different in each region but it was 
rich, aromatic and spicy. The cooking utensils used, that 
is the degh or degchi and handi were common as these

Cooking utensils play an important part in the preparation 
process.  Down  the  ages,  pots  and  pans  discovered  by 

78

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiawere used in the preparation of traditional North Indian 
cuisine.

While the British were in India till 1947 they introduced 
a cuisine of their own. Anglo-Indian cooking was almost 
a culinary balancing act of local ingredients and foreign 
tastes. Mulligatawny, kedgeree, Indian curry powder and 
Worcestershire  sauce  are  all  products  of  the  British  Raj. 
The pots and pans used by the bawarchis cooking for the 
British were of Indian origin.

We  learn  from  history  that  not  all  food  was  cooked  in 
utensils.  The  hordes  of  Mongols  invaders  who  came  in 
search of riches to India chose to eat while in the saddle. 
They  gorged  on  chunks  of  meat  roasted  on  hot  slabs  of 
rock  or  on  skewers  over  logwood  fires  as  they  did  not 
find time to cook regular meals. From the 13th to the 16th 
centuries, the armies of Chengiz Khan, Taimur Lang and 
Babur  were  compelled  to  travel  long  distances  on  foot, 
horses and  camels to  reach  India. Those roasted chunks 
must have tasted like today’s barbecued steaks minus the 
sauces. 

There were other forms of unconventional cooking which 
are  prevalent  even  today.  The  Patthar  ke  Kebab  owe 
their  origins  to  the  erstwhile  nawabi  era  of  Hyderabad. 
Marinated lamb is cooked over a patthar (stone). A black 
granite stone about half-an-inch thick is heated over a bed 
of hot charcoal and the meat is cooked on the stone.

Another form of an “outdoor” kitchen is the khad (deep 
pit) style of cooking of Rajasthan. When hunting wildlife 
was not considered a violation of animal rights, members 
of  the  royal  family  would  set  out  on  a  shikar.  The  big 
game would be carried back to the castle by coolies, minor 
shikar such as wild boar, teetar (partridge), bater (quail) 
and rabbits were lunchtime fare for the hungry hunters in 
the jungle. 

80

In  the  khad  style  of  cooking  large  leaves  and  mitti  (wet 
earth) were used in lieu of a utensil. The heat source at the 
base of the pit was by burning charcoal covered with dry 
twigs and cow dung to provide the heat. The marinated 
shikar was tightly wrapped in the leaves, which were then 
coated  with  mitti  and  placed  in  the  pit  which  was  then 
covered with sand. After a passage of time the pit was dug 
up, the dried-up mitti crust was broken and the deliciously 
aromatic preparation, cooked in its own juices, was ready 
to  be  eaten.  The  Khad  khargosh  is  prepared  today  on 
special occasions replicating those shikar days. 

The Kashmiri preparation of Gushtaba and Rishta involves 
the pounding of pieces of boneless mutton along with the 
fat  with  a  wooden  mallet  on  a  wooden  block  overnight 
till the strands of mutton split and the mutton turns into 
mince which is used to form koftas.

Since  centuries  cooking  utensils  have  been  made  out  of 
different materials and defined shapes based on the dish 
to  be  prepared  in  them,  style  of  cooking,  temperature 
required  and  source  of  heat.  Utensils  of  different  eras 
were based on the local and regional agricultural produce, 
which was governed by the environmental surroundings 
such as climatic conditions, supply of water and quality of

the soil. Manmade influences included religious traditions, 
community taboos, caste distinctions and prevalent zaika 
(taste).   

 

 

 

 

 

All  these  factors  combined  to  define  the  cuisine  of  each 
generation, their cultural milieu, social philosophies and 
economic standing. Although cuisines, recipes, ingredients 
and styles of cooking differed from region to region, there 
was not much of a difference in the conventional designs 
of the utensils.

A reflection on the socio-economic system that prevailed in 
India centuries ago was that shelves of royal kitchens and 
the upper classes were agleam with silverware. Intricately 
worked serving dishes made of gold, silver and base metal 
belonged  to  those  classes.  The  metals  were  believed  to 
impart purifying and healing properties to the food.

Terracotta kitchenware was for ordinary people. In common 
use  in  the  clay-rich  areas  of  the  Indo-Gangetic  plains  of 
the North, these sun-baked vessels were environmentally-
friendly. They were ideal for preparing dishes over even 
heat. Cooking in earthenware vessels imparted a unique 
flavour to the food.

Those living in the eastern, western and southern regions 
used utensils made of various metals and alloys, the areas 
being  mineral  rich.  Another  reason  was  that  they  did 
not  break  as  easily  as  pots  and  pans  made  of  clay.  Cast 
iron cookware is heavy, doesn’t rust easily. Food cooked 
in them enhances the iron content of the food benefiting 
those with iron deficiency. 

Aluminum  was  introduced  in  India  in  the  earlier  1800s. 
Affordable, light and strong, it was a good conductor of 
heat but not a good cooking alloy as contact with strong 
acids,  alkalis  and  salt  from  food  caused  the  metal  to 
dissolve. Peetal (brass) is an alloy of tamba (copper) and 
zinc, while bronze (kansa) is an alloy of copper and tin. 

Copper and brass vessels react to acids and salt and can 
cause food poisoning. Therefore they must be coated with 
kalai (tinning) regularly.

Just  as  bronze  disappeared  during  the  1950s,  brass  and 
copper  utensils  have  also  been  replaced  with  stainless 
steel  cookware.  Superior  conductors  of  heat,  they  are 
rarely seen in kitchens today as they wear out easily and 
require kalai frequently. Till the 1960s the kalaiwallah was 
a regular visitor to all homes to bring a shine to the utensils. 
Popularity of stainless steel drove him out of business.

Copper is still used to clad the exterior of stainless steel 
cookware  for  heat  conduction  as  stainless  steel  is  not  a 
good heat conductor. Some cookwares use a sandwiched 
layer of aluminum at the base for uniform heating. Such 
vessels are called heavy bottomed.

Cooking utensils retained their original shapes even when 
the  material  used  in  their  manufacture  kept  changing. 
Down the ages recipes and tastes have changed, culinary 
preferences  and  perceptions  kept  shifting  but 
the 
conventional shape of the utensils has not altered. 

The type of utensils used in Indian kitchens for cooking 
depends on the dish to be prepared, ingredients and the 
style of cooking. A selection of cooking utensils includes: 

DEGH / DEGCHI: Not usually 
seen  in  modern-day  kitchens, 
this  brass  vessel  with  a 
spherical base tapering sharply 
from the middle and ending in 
a narrow opening allows steam 
to  condense  and  roll  back  into 
the  food.  Ideally  used  for  the 
traditional slow-cooking process today known as the Dum 
Pukht style of cooking.

is used for cooking Dum Biryanis over a slow fire, and for 
preparing curries requiring low heat. The handi has been 
used for centuries and has been handed down from one 
generation to another.

PATEELA / BHAGONA: A circular vessel made of brass 
or stainless steel. It has straight walls and a narrow brim 
and is used to boil milk or cook many types of dishes.

KARHAI:  A  shallow  wok  with  a 
round  base.  Traditionally  made  of 
copper or brass, it has generally been 
replaced  by  stainless  steel.  Deep 
frying,  sautéing  and  making  dry 
preparations are done in the karhai.

CHAKLA  &  BELAN:  The  dough  for  chapatis  is  rolled 
out on the traditional chakla, a round board, and belan, a 
rolling pin.

TAVA: A round thick iron griddle with a slight concave in 
the centre, it is a must in most Indian households. Used for 
making rotis, chappatis and parathas.

SIL  BATTA:  The  sil  is  a 
flat  stone  and  the  batta  a 
cylindrical grinding stone. 
Used  pan-India,  having 
different  names, 
these 
grinding  stones  are  used 
to  prepare  chutneys  and 
spice mixes for cooking in 
the  North,  East  and  West  and  to  grind  soaked  lentils  in 
preparation for dosas and vadas by South Indians.

TANDOOR: A  cylindrical  clay  oven  with  thick  walls  to 
retain the heat generated by burning charcoal at the base. 
Used  for  roasting  or  baking  tandoori  rotis,  vegetables, 
paneer (cottage cheese), marinated mutton and chicken.

82

BAGHAR: Small frying pan with a long handle, used for 
giving tarka (tempering) to dals and vegetables.

BOTI  (chopper),  CHULHA  (stove),  CHAKKI  (wheat 
grinder) have no utility in modern urban kitchens designed 
for stand-up operations. These are commonly used today 
by villagers in the rural belts of India. 

Museums  are  repositories  for  preserving  a  community’s 
heritage and identity. They serve to propagate a way of life 
that existed in the pre-industrialization days and provide 
a window to look into bygone eras, where royalty enjoyed 
manifold luxuries, when simplicity was part of rural life. 

The National Museum in New Delhi, Lothal Archaeological 
Museum, 80 km from Ahmedabad and the British Museum 
in  London  have  galleries  with  Indus  Valley  civilization 
artifacts and terracotta. 

A  museum  that  has  been  preserving  heritage  cooking 
utensils is the Vishalia Environmental Center for Heritage 
of  Art  Architecture  and  Research  (VECHAAR)  in  the 
vicinity of Vishalla Village restaurant in Ahmedabad. 

Brainchild of architect Mr. Surender C. Patel, it was built 
in  1981  and  has  more  than  3,500  Indian  pots  and  pans

that  were  crafted  by  local  potters.  Some  of  the  utensils 
on  display  are  more  than  1,000  years  old  and  include 
other kitchen-related memorabilia such as pots, pitchers, 
nutcrackers and betel boxes.

VECHAAR is an extensive collection of utensils that have 
evolved  over  different  periods  of  history  as  a  result  of 
changing needs and the environment. The range of items 
varies from plates made of leaves or a gourd jug to modern 
stainless  steel  and  glass  utensils.  Metal  utensils  include 
those  made  of  brass,  copper,  bronze,  zinc  and  German 
silver.

The  museum,  listed  as  an  “Attraction”  on  the  Gujarat 
Tourism  website,  is  an  effort  to  cherish  and  preserve 
India’s rich cultural heritage and rare artistic skills of our 
craftsmen.

In Pune the Raja Dinakar Kelkar Museum, founded in 1920, 
displays household vessels of the 18th and 19th centuries. 
The  vessels,  made  of  terracotta,  copper  and  brass,  were 
brought from Kerala, Gujarat and Maharashtra. Kitchen-
related  equipment  includes  copper  ovens,  spice  boxes, 
coconut  slicers,  metal  plates,  spoon  hangers,  etc.  in 
different shapes and sizes.

Much can be learnt about a people, their recipes, cooking 
process  and  tastes  from  their  cooking  utensils.  Ancient 
pots and pans, a slice of life of the times they were used 
in should be given a place in museums in all parts of the 
country.

I  suggest  that  small  museums,  such  as  VECHAAR  in 
Ahmedabad,  be  developed  in  other  states.  The  Ministry 
of  Tourism  needs  to  take  the  initiative  in  preservation, 
maintenance,  conservation  and  promotion  of  India’s 
culinary heritage. 

For a beginning, the first museum could be opened in the 
Indian Culinary Institute which will begin operations in 
2016-17.  The  Ministry  also  needs  to  organize,  as  part  of 
the research in Indian regional cuisines, documentation of 
the vessels in which specific dishes were prepared. This 
will help develop aesthetic awareness among the people 
and encourage them to seek newer tastes through ancient 
cooking practices.

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaA Brief Glimpse of the  
Mathur’s and their Cuisine

Preeta Mathur

“Eat,  drink  and  be  a  Mathur”,  was  the  catchy  title  of  a 
long  article  on  the  Mathur  community  that  appeared 
in  the  popular  illustrated  weekly  in  the  1960’s.  Though 
apt the statement is at best partly true, Mathur’s, one of 
the  12  branches  of  the  Kayastha  community,  have  since 
times long gone by, been well known for the high level of 
intellectual and cultural accomplishments. In recognition 
of this, Mathur’s found themselves highly sought after and 
respected  as  ministers,  generals,  judges,  administrators, 
lawyers  and  doctors.  Their  close  proximity  to  the  royal 
dynasty took them to the far corners of the country from 
Kashmir to Bengal to Hyderabad, where they settled down 
as highly respected members of those societies. In addition 
to all these refinements, another very progressive trait of 
the  Mathur’s  that  has  been  that  women  have  been  well 
educated,  highly  respected  and  talented  singers,  artists 
and culinary experts. The community has throughout time 
shunned socially reprehensible practices like dowry and 
other social abuses pertaining to women. 

With an open minded and positive attitude, it took little 
time  for  Mathur’s  to  adapt  to  local  conditions  wherever 
they  migrated  to  with  royal  founding  dynasties  and  to 
absorb local languages, customs and cultural influences. 
This impact is clearly visible in the cuisine popular among 
Mathur households in different parts of the country.

An  outstanding  example  of  this  integration  is  the 
Hyderabadi  Mathur’s.  A  few  families  were  part  of  the 
founding  entourage  of  the  Nizam  dynasty.  Ever  since 
then,  Mathur’s  have  held  high  and  influential  positions 

in  successive  courts  of  the  Nizams  and  to  date  carry 
the  title  of  ‘Raja’.  Today,  when  Mathur’s  of  the  North 
meet  their  Hyderabadi  brethren  the  comparisons  are 
just as remarkable as the contrasts. Their cuisine reflects 
the  dominant  local  impact  of  the  strong  preference  for 
chillies.  Well  known  Mathur  preparations  which  went 
to  the  Deccan  with  the  old  families  have  returned  with 
distinctive  characteristics  of  their  own  like  Garley  (deep 
fried  minced  balls  dipped  in  gram  flour  batter),  Tootak 
(non  veg  baked  kachouris)  and  Lukhmi  (stuffed  small 
pillow shaped savouries).

Similar, is the position of the old settled Mathur families 
of deep west Rajasthan around Jodhpur and Bikaner. My 
husband Viresh, who studied in Mayo college, Ajmer tells 
me  that  the  food  habits,  the  language  spoken  by  these 
families are more akin to the locals then to Mathur’s from 
Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. On the food front ‘Soolas’ are a 
popular preparation which consists of succulent, boneless 
pieces  of  chicken  and  lamb  which  are  barbecued.  The 
Soolas  are  first  marinated  with  raw  papaya  and  kachri 
to tenderise them. Then ‘dhangar’ (smoking) is given by 
placing 2 live charcoals in a small steel bowl. This is placed 
in the middle of the marinated meat. 2 cloves are placed 
on the cinders and 1 tsp ghee is dropped on them. When 
it starts to smoke it is covered with a lid. The smoke thus 
trapped  inside  incorporates  with  the  meat,  giving  it  an 
exotic smoky flavour.

Major  festivals  like  Holi,  Dussehra  and  Diwali  are 
celebrated by all Mathur’s wherever they may be located. 

84

Amidst,  great  joy  and  conviviality  among  large  family 
groups  with  plenty  of  food,  drinks  and  music.  Holi  has 
been  traditionally  been  associated  with  the  preparation 
and serving of Papri, Goojas and Kanji ke Bade.

Most  Mathur  families  can  trace  their  roots  to  several 
preceding  generations.  Accordingly,  different  families 
have  nuanced  and  typical  ways  of  observing  different 
socio-religious  ceremonies.  In  the  same  vein,  different 
families were well known for different food preparations. 
Since  these  were  handed  down  from  one  generation  to 
another the custodians jealously guarded them. Needless 
to say these rare culinary gems were hardly ever committed 
to paper and were handed down by word of mouth and 
over  kitchen  fires.  Mathur  cooking  is  distinguished  by 
the  subtle  blending  of  aromas,  flavours,  and  cooking 
techniques,  most  notably  ‘bhuna’,  ‘dum’  and  ‘dhungar’, 
which are sublime forms of culinary art. 

Some of the exotic Mathur dishes are Shabdeg in which 
meats  and  vegetables  are  simmered  overnight  in  a  pot 
over charcoal fire, Siri where goats head is cooked in exotic 
spices and Daulat ki chaat, a delectable winter dessert of 
whipped milk foam chilled in the nights stew.

In  Delhi,  the  traditional  Mathur  strong  holds  were  the 
lanes and by lanes of Chandni chowk, Nayi sadak, Chira 
khana,  Daryaganj  and  Jamna  road.  The  famous  Chuki 
matar (succulent tender whole green pea pods cooked in 
tangy masala) and Aloo ke kulle (boiled scooped potatoes 
filled with sprouts, pomegranate seeds, chat masala and 
lemon juice) are very popular.

In  Uttar  Pradesh,  the  small  and  only  Mathur  princely 
state  of  Daryabad  near  Lukhnow  is  celebrated  for  its 
exquisite and unique cuisine and in special snacks called 
‘Phale’ which are stuffed wheat flour savouries, tampered 
with  whole  red  chillies  and  fenugreek  seeds.  A  typical 

Mathur  preparation  Bari  Bauwa  Ki  Handi  is  an  earthy 
flavoured  chicken  preparation,  cooked  without  onions, 
in a new earthen pot/handi. The pot gives the chicken a 
unique  earthy  fragrance  and  flavour.  Another  popular 
vegetarian dish is ‘Takke Paise’- a relative of Gatte ki Sabzi. 
It is a versatile dish with a deft play of ingredients. Lovely 
Mathur adds soaked and pureed dried figs, Geeta Shankar 
adds  carom  seeds  and  kachri  and  my  mother  used  a 
portion  of  prepared  masala  and  yogurt  while  kneading 
the gram flour. Potli pulao, Yakhni pulao, Matar ki Tahiri 
and Ramchane ki tahiri are popular rice dishes.

Since the Mathur’s love for good food is a unique trait it 
would be interesting to note that some Mathur ladies who 
were  vegetarian  could  none  the  less  produce  the  most 
delectable  non  vegetarian  preparations.  A  case  in  point 
is  my  own  mother.  Though  a  vegetarian,  her  Pasandas 
(artfully beaten pieces of boneless lamb), roast leg, dum 
fish  and  patila  chaap  (lamb  chops)  were  to  die  for  even 
though  she  never  tasted  the  preparation.  Similarly,  my 
aunt in law cooked a unique melt in the mouth Raan which 
took 3 days of pounding, grinding, marinations and slow 
fire cooking before being brought to the dining table.

My  maternal  uncles,  a  leading  family  from  Patiala  were 
great hunters. I recall most wistfully my childhood visits 
to my maternal home in Patiala where I vividly remember 
my  uncle  emerging  from  his  mud  splattered  jeep  in  his 
shikaar  outfit  with  shoulders  drooping  from  the  weight 
of guns and all kinds of game meats. This was followed 
with  much  bustle  of  cutting,  marinating  and  cooking  of 
the game meats by family members among noisy scenes 
of  laughter,  shikaar  anecdotes,  drinking,  singing  and 
massive eating.

The Mathurs zest for life makes them one of the unique 
communities of our country.

yAKHNI/POTLI PULAO
Potli pulao is cooked like yakhni pulao. In potli pulao, a 
selection of aromatic spices is tied in a muslin cloth like a 
bouquet garni (potli) to prevent them from dispersing into 
the yakhni (stock) while boiling. The spice potli releases 
flavours which get incorporated into the lamb stock. The 
bouquet  garni  is  squeezed  to  pull  out  the  flavours  and 
then discarded. In yakhni pulao, the spices are boiled with 
the meat and later strained.

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiafar  greater  food  security  but  enhanced  humans  ability 
to  undertake  longer  and  farther  journeys  and  became  a 
critical  ingredient  for  the  spread  of  humanity  when  we 
became seafarers.

Pickles also provided a source of vitamin C necessary to 
prevent  scurvy.  It  would  be  fair  to  say  that,  were  it  not 
for  pickles,  Christopher  Columbus  might  never  have 
“discovered” America. In his 1492 voyage, Columbus or 
more  precisely  Amerigo  Vespucci  (a  well-known  pickle 
merchant)  gave  rations  of  pickles  to  sailors  to  prevent 
them from getting scurvy, leading them to complete their 
voyage.

Pickling itself has had its own evolution. From a position 
of being a vital technology for food security it has refined 
into an art form.

India,  also  suffering  from  extreme  temperatures,  not 
producing  sufficient  vegetables  in  summers,  facing  crop 
failure  due  to  excessive  rains  or  draught,  long  and  cold 
winters  killing  crops  due  to  frost,  all  lead  to  fermented 
food or pickling as a necessity.

Indian pickles, as we understand them today, are all about 
taste.  The  use  of  the  regional  term  for  pickles  in  Hindi, 
Urdu,  Bengali,  Assamese,  Sindhi  and  Punjabi,  “Achar” 
creates in every Indian an instant expectation of a virtual 
barrage of contrasting yet complimenting flavors bursting 
on the palate triggering waves of serotonin in the brain. An 
Indian can never be said, to be a true Indian if his system 
does not demand Achar as a regular fare. It is a tribute to 
this special food that we define ourselves in terms of the 
kind of pickles we relish. While the common thread that 
unites all Indians is the famous Mango achar, I am likely 
to be from Andhra if I like Ghongura achar, a Benarsi if 
my favourite is spice stuffed Red Chilli pickle, a Gujarati, 
if  I  like  my  Gur  Kairi  (Young  mangoes  with  jaggery) 
or  Chhunda  (sweet  jaggery  grated  mango  pickle  with 

spices)  and  an Assamese  if  I  love  Jolphai  jola  aru  mitha 
aasaar”made with Indian olives.

The  greatest  custodians  of  our  pickle  heritage  have 
traditionally  been  our  grandmothers.  The  repertoire 
of  grandma’s  pickle  in  most  households  is  diverse  and 
unique.  In  many  ways  it’s  a  family  heirloom.  In  an  U.P 
Khattri  household,  to  which  I  belong,  is  known  for  the 
Khattri  Achar  and  we  our  proud  of  having  at  least  50 
different varieties of pickles ranging from “ caronda achar, 
lasoda achar, hing Ki Kairi, mitha khuchla, Aam achar or 
kathal achar, it’s almost mandatory to have at least five to 
six different kinds of pickles on the dining table.

Our baptism in pickle takes place very early in life. From 
early  childhood  Indians  are  exposed  to  the  exploding 
flavours that will stick to them for the rest of their lives. 
For  me,  the  sweet  “gudamba”  (jaggery  mango)  pickles 
that have a surfeit of fennel seeds in it with rice and Daal 
(lentil)  was  an  early  favourite. As  my  palate  matured,  I 
started to love the pungent hing (asafetida) mango pickle 
in  two  variations,  the  truly  sour  version  and  the  sweet 
and  sour  version.  Like  an  explorer,  I  discovered  that 
these pickles go really well with homemade crisp mathri, 
another Khatri favorite snack.

The kathal achar tastes best when eaten with Paranthas. 
But  Jackfruit  is  seasonal,  like  many  other  pickles  such 
as  lemon  pickle  in  winters,  mango  pickle  in  summers, 
vegetable pickles in mild winters etc. 

One of the most exotic achar is called the Mango Gilori. 
The large sized raw mangoes are de skinned, traditionally 
by an improvised de skinning “sepia”(a natural sea shell 
with  a  hole  in  the  center  and  rubbed  against  a  stone  to 
make the cutting edge sharp). Then, with a lot of dexterity, 
thin layers of the mango would be peeled, so that from a 
single mango a long piece of a thin layer of mango slice 
is  obtained.  Then,  a  specially  prepared  masala  that  has

Indian Pickles and Palate

Rattan Capoor

The evolution of humans as modern social beings is in a 
strange way inextricably linked to the history of pickles. 
More precisely, the art of pickling and its less appreciated 
role  and  contribution  to  the  development  of  modern 
humans. Let us go back in time to the age of the advent 
of  agriculture,  some  8,000  to  10,000  years  ago.  Homo 
sapiens  were  beginning  to  settle  after  some  150,000  to 
190,000 years of foraging for food as hunters and gatherers 

much like our cousin apes, thanks to the discovery of our 
ability to grow food by planting seeds. That was a defining 
moment  for  humans,  as  it  changed  the  fundamentals  of 
living. Now, unlike before, we had food security! It was 
not before another 4000 years later that humans, in the part 
of the world called India, started pickling. This discovery 
of being able to preserve food, for out of season use and 
more  particularly  for  long  journeys  enabled  not  only 

90

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiasugar, garam masala, black pepper and salt is put in the 
center of this layer and wrapped around in the shape of a 
paan (prepared beetle leaf) and is then held together with 
a “clove”. The Gilori is then matured in a sugar and salt 
mix and when it matures in about three or four days in full 
sunlight, it’s a pickle to die for!!!

There are several methods of pickling and there are several 
pickling materials, the most common being mustard oil. 
Of course the main preservative is salt and every pickle, 
without exception has high amounts of salt. This includes 
the ‘sweet’ pickles too. In fact the salt and sugar proportions 
are  critical  in  achieving  the  fine  balance  that  defines  an 
achar. Where Mustard oil is used as a preservative many 
recipes require that the oil drown all the other ingredients 
in the pickle.

The sweet jaggery or sugar pickles have no oil and some 
recipes  require  the  pickles  to  be  cooked.  Yet  another 
method requires raw seasonal vegetables cut into pieces 
picked  in  mustard  seed  (not  oil),  salt,  sugar  and  some 
other spices. The vegetables are cooked by the action of 
salt,  sugar,  mustard  seeds  and  a  few  days  of  sunlight 
and  ready  to  be  eaten.  This  type  of  pickle  is  popular  in 
Punjab and Delhi where it is eaten in winters. Moreover, 
these pickles are also then indicators of the abundance of 
vegetables, fruits and special food produce of that specific 
season.

My love for achar finds me searching for artisanal achar 
wherever I go in India. Last year in Bhuj, on our way to 
the great Rann of Kutch, I found myself buying from an 
exhibition thirty types of pickles, some of them made of 
wild berries that I had never seen! Another year on a visit 
to  the  Himachal,  I  could  lay  my  hands  on  chicken  and 
mutton achar sold by the locals in the lower slopes of the 
hills as we went to Manali. In my childhood I had feasted 
on wild boar pickle that I faintly remember as being gifted 
by a family from the area below UP hills.

92

In a special way, pickles can be a complete replacement of 
vegetables and pulses. 

Pickles also democratic and secular. It cuts across religion 
and caste lines and is universal in appeal, whether in rural 
India, where most farmers will have achar and onions with 
their roti or urban India where any and every restaurant 
will present some kind of achar, to every household that 
will have a bottle ready on the table.

However,  all  is  not  well  with  the  state  of  health  of  the 
Indian pickle. The challenges to the diversity of pickles are 
a reflection of real life itself. Much like the rapid extinction 
of many species on account of anthropological pressures, 
the  diversity  of  pickles  is  threatened  by  the  limited 
offerings of commercial pickles coupled with the neglect 
of  the  new  generation  that  seems  to  be  disinterested  in 
carrying the family traditions partly due to lack of time or 
the hard work involved.

But  there  is  always  the  possibility  of  a  renaissance.  The 
more I think about it the more I get excited at the thought 
of  a  grand  “Indian  Pickle  renaissance  “  where  one  can 
expect  renewed  interest  in  the  traditional  art  of  pickles, 
experimenting  with  new  methods  of  pickling,  new  and 
exotic ingredients and even fusion of several styles. In this 
age of renewed creativity, we can expect first a trickle and 
then  a  barrage  of  new  enthusiasts  giving  new  meaning 
to  the  traditional  achar.  Over  the  last  two  decades, 
mainstream food is experiencing a renaissance of sorts and 
a fusion revolution. It is only a matter of time when the 
pickle will witness a similar renaissance. I hope it happens 
sooner than later. The traditional Indian pickles with then 
have its new cousins.

I am waiting for the cousins to arrive as I constantly seek 
and  savor  the  traditional  Indian  pickles  from  all  across 
India.

The Cuisine of Malwa

Pallavi Mishra

The  Malwa  region  has  geographically  and  historically 
been a land of plenty; be it the magical ratio of the rain 
and  shine  the  region  receives  or  the  bounties  of  nature 
one can see all around. At their heart, both the food of this 
region, as well as the people who prepare it, are simple, 
wholesome and full of the best gifts nature has to offer.

Traditionally, jowar (sorghum) was a staple cereal not just 
in  Madhya  Pradesh,  but  throughout  North  and  Central 

India,  but  after  the  Green  Revolution  in  India,  wheat 
has replaced jowar as the most important food crop. The 
districts of Western Madhya Pradesh and parts of South-
Eastern  Rajasthan,  that  constitute  the  region  of  Malwa 
grows some of the best wheat in the world. The Chandosi 
and  Sharbati  varieties  grown  here  are  second  to  none 
across the globe. The preponderance of wheat thus in the 
common man’s daily life is a natural outcome.

93

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiathe  base  of  the  traditional  breads  of  Malwa-  bafla,  bati 
or  the  more  common  roti.  In  villages,  wheat  is  soaked 
overnight and boiled in the morning to create a healthy 
munching option called ghuggri, which can be eaten sweet 
or savoury. Similarly, no festival big or small is complete 
without sweets made out of gur (jaggery) in combination 
with one or more cereals. Gur ki thuli is a kind of porridge 
made  of  broken  wheat  and  gur  is  especially  consumed 
on the occasion of Renuka Chaudas. Gaakar is a kind of 
caramelised hard biscuit made of roasted wheat flour and 
gur that is offered as Prasad in pujas associated with the 
Goddess and Lord Ganpati.

Being primarily agrarian, the people of Malwa follow their 
customs  and  rituals  fondly  and  keep  close  track  of  the 
changing seasons. The climate is mostly dry throughout 
the year, but the rainfall is very heavy. Added to that, the 
volcanic, clay-like soil of the region requires less irrigation 
because of its high capacity of moisture retention. In light 
of such conditions, most people store their food grains and 
pulses for use through the year while seasonal vegetables 
are  available  fresh  throughout  the  year.  Because  fresh, 
locally  grown  vegetables  are  plentiful,  Malwa  has  an 
interesting  culture  of  making  seasonal  specialties.  Every 
season  -  summer,  winter  and  the  monsoon  has  distinct 
delicacies that are enjoyed only at that time of the year and 
not otherwise. 

A typical snack of Malwa is the bhutte ki kees - made with 
grated  corn,  mustard  seeds,  plenty  of  chilies  and  lemon 
juice. In a sweet variation, it is also made with grated corn 
roasted  in  ghee  and  later  cooked  in  milk  with  spices.  It 
is a hearty and healthy comfort food served steaming hot 
on  wet  monsoon  days.  To  make  it  perfectly,  the  locally 
grown makka, or maize should be young and the grains 
should be soft and doodhia (milky). They should, in short, 
be harvested after the first rain shower. If by chance, the 
kees is made with ripe or dry corn, it loses its characteristic 
flavor and consistency. 

Bhutte	ki	kees
A typical recipe for Bhutte ke kees would be:

Ingredients
•  Grated Corn 1 and 1/2 cup
•  Gram flour 2 tablespoon
•  Green chilies 2 chopped
•  Asafoetida a pinch
•  Turmeric powder 1/4 teaspoon
•  Mustard seeds 1 teaspoon
•  Cumin seeds 1/2 teaspoon
•  Aniseed/saunf powder 1 table spoon
•  Red chilli powder 1 tea spoon
•  Salt to taste
•  Sugar 1 teaspoon
•  Lemon juice from 1 lemon
•  Coriander leaves (for garnishing)
•  Oil/ghee 2 tablespoon

Method
Grate corn cobs and set aside. Heat oil/ghee in a pan. Add 
cumin seeds and mustard seeds to it and allow them to 
splutter.  Add  Asafoetida  and  Gram  flour  to  it  and  stir 
continuously for 2 minutes. Now add Grated corn, green 
chilies,  salt,  sugar  and  turmeric  powder.  Mix  well  and 
cover the pan with a lid and cook in slow flame for 3-4 

minutes.  Stir  the  mixture  and  cook  again  for  5  minutes. 
Add aniseed powder and red chilli powder. Mix well and 
turn off the flame. Add lemon juice and chopped coriander 
leaves. Serve Hot.

Similarly, in summer, the mango season is much awaited. 
From March to June, as the temperature rises, the mango 
trees start to fruit. The kachchi keri (young unripe mango) 
is harvested and used in multifarious ways. Amolya is a 
sweet-sour dal made with tuar and kachchi keri. The keri 
is also used to make various kinds of chutneys, kachumber 
salad  (assorted  vegetable  salad)  and  a  special  kind  of 
vegetable called fajita. To make fajita, the pulp from the 
seed of the keri is extracted and washed in water or milk. It 
is then tempered with heeng, zeera, curry leaves, salt and 
chilli powder. This is a unique dish not found anywhere 
else, as is Rasaal, an astonishing preparation of rice cooked 
in freshly squeezed sugar cane juice. This is a traditional 
Malwi dish that has all but disappeared, even in villages.

Winter has its own typical food rituals. Chana (Garbanzo 
beans or chick peas) is sown at the onset of winter. A Malwi 
folk legend says that chana should be sown when the air 
is cold enough to solidify ghee. Fifteen days after sowing, 
young  shoots  bearing  tender  leaves  emerge  and  these 
are then used to make chane ki bhaji, a winter delicacy. 
Another typical wintery Malwi dish is gwar-pata ki bati, 
(bati  made  from  wheat  flour  and  aloe  vera)  commonly 
eaten  to  ward  off  aches  and  pains  associated  with  the 
winter months.

I  visited  Bada  Rawla  in  Juni,  Indore,  the  home  of  Rao 
Raja  Rao  Shreekant  Zamindar  and  his  wife  Madhavi, 
descendants  of  Rao  Raja  Chaudhary  Nandlal  Mandloi, 
who established the city of Indore in 1716. 

At  Bada  Rawla,  I  had  the  opportunity  to  taste  and

The first thing that strikes you as you look closely at the 
multitude of dishes made here, is a predominance of food 
grains- be it bajra (millet), jowar (sorghum), makka (maize)

and  semi-processed  form,  alone  or  in  combination  with 
other cereals, in sweet as well as savoury form. It forms

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional  Malwa  food  has  elements  of  Rajasthani, 
Gujarati  and  Maharashtrian  cuisine,  and  this  is  very 
evident from the overwhelming use of tempering agents- 
sesame,  desiccated  coconut,  curry  leaves  and  mustard 
seeds  that  have  found  their  way  into  dishes  made  in 
most households. Centuries of Maratha rule have led to 
puranpoli  and  shreekhand  being  sweets  that  are  found 
in  households  across  the  region.  However,  besan  ki 
chakki  (sweet  made  of  gram  flour)  and  nakti  ke  laddu 
(Boondi laddu) are the dishes that are to be found in any 
religious ceremony or celebration or wedding. The typical 
Maharashtrian  breakfast  dish  of  pohe  (flattened  rice)  is 
a hot favourite of Malwi people and some estimate that 
an approximate three truckloads of pohe is consumed in 
Indore alone, every single day!

Pohe
Rajasthan  finds  its  way  into  the  food  of  Malwa  in  the 
generous use of spices, particularly red chilli powder. A 
species of red chilli called Nimari mirch is grown here and 
is famous for its colour and aroma.

The  influence  of  Rajasthan  is  also  seen  in  the  love  for 
dal- bati and dal-bafla. There are two distinct differences 
between  the  Rajasthani  version  and  the  Malwi  cousin. 
Firstly,  in  Rajasthan,  the  bati  (wheat  bread)  is  baked 
underground over coals and dung cakes and then soaked 
in ghee, while in Malwa the bafla is first boiled in water 
and  then  baked  over  the  dung  cakes.  Secondly,  the  dal 
made along with bati in Rajasthan is a mix of five lentil 
varieties, called pachmeli dal, whereas in Malwa, only tuar 

dal is used and the taste has a hint of sweetness as well as 
the distinct sourness of tamarind (imli) and is called khatti-
meethi dal. The Rajasthani dal bati will almost always be 
accompanied by gatte ki sabzi, kadhi and choorma. This is 
not compulsory in Malwa, where dal bafla is a complete 
meal in itself. There is also a difference in shape, bati being 
almost spherical, while the bafla is disc like, almost like a 
doughnut or bagel.

Many of the traditional foods of the region are also closely 
associated with the vrats (fasts) and teej tyohar (festivals 
and  religious  ceremonies)  that  are  followed  as  per  the 
Hindu calendar. The large number of fasts that people keep 
very faithfully has led to a highly developed repertoire of 
vrat  cuisine.  Sabudane  ki  khichdi  (dish  made  of  tapioca 
sago), aloo ka kees (savoury grated potato), chonki mirch, 
rajgir  ka  halwa,  etc.  are  dishes  created  with  love  and 
reverence so that one can feast in their fast.
Thali for Vrat ( Fasting)
Some  unusual  customs  associated  with  food  are  also 
followed in Malwa. Halchat is an occasion in September- 
October  in  which,  only  those  vegetables  or  grains  are 

cooked  that  have  been  untouched  by  a  hal  (plough). 
Separately, in Chaturmas, a period of four months when 
the  Gods  are  believed  to  retire  from  the  earthly  world 
into  slumber,  certain  rituals  are  followed  by  the  royal 
households  of  Malwa,  like  the  Zamindars’  which  forbid 
the  intake  of  baingan  (Brinjal)  and  methi  (Fenugreek). 
This  ban  is  lifted  on  the  festival  of  Dusshera,  when 
baingan ke pakode (brinjal fritters) are made along with 
kadhi (spiced curry made of yoghurt and gram flour) and 
offered as prasad to the Goddess, and the vegetables can 
be consumed henceforth. Dishes made for the Royals were 
often tempered using a gold guinea, as it is believed that 
gold and silver have restorative powers.

Being  mostly  vegetarian,  the  people  of  Malwa  have 
developed innovative recipes that are uniquely Malwi, out 
of staples that are found all over our country. The food is 
rustic, flavourful and very wholesome. Everything is fresh, 
grows  locally  and  the  quality  of  produce  is  superlative. 
Traditional recipes have been created to suit the seasonal 
harvest. The cuisine, in essence is a true reflection of the 
benevolence of nature on this land.

Uma Jadhav

(EDN) 

is  an 

International 
Earth  Day  Network 
Environmental NGO that has grown out of the first Earth 
Day  based  in  USA,  forty  five  years  ago.  One  can  only 
imagine  the  need  in  the  1970’s  for  such  an  organisation 
seeing  our  own  country’s  pathetic  pollution  and  neglect 
of resources. In India, this NGO now engages over 50,000 
organizations  in  over  192  countries  around  the  world 
to  broaden,  diversify  and  energize  the  environmental 
movement.  In  2010,  EDN  opened  an  office  in  India.  A 
meeting by chance with EDN India Director- Mrs Karuna 
Singh  at  an  organic  bazar  at  Kolkata  led  us  to  have 
Madhya Pradesh’s first organic mela at Gwalior. She had 
mentioned that they wanted to start their work in Madhya 
Pradesh  and  I  offered  our  premises  free  as  the  cause  of 
cleaning and greening the environment is very dear to me. 
Her commitment to the NGO is hundred percent and her 
team tirelessly works in different parts of the country with 
students,  women  and  the  community.  ‘Go  organic’  is  a 
major program EDN runs in India to build awareness of the 
benefits of organic and natural food and lifestyle products 
by  providing  platforms  to  bring  together  manufacturers 
and sellers of these products with the consumers. 

I  have  been  brought  up  to  love  nature,  despite  a  very 
modern educational background. Listening to the sounds 
of  a  flowing  stream,  chirping  of  birds,  crossing  rivers, 
climbing  mountains,  sitting  in  silence  out  in  the  open 
under  a  canopy  of  stars,  meeting  local  families  and 
learning  about  conservation  of  the  environment  at  the 

98

grass  roots  level,  respect  for  nature  –  even  landslides; 
making  puddings  with  the  help  of  flowing  Himalayan 
streams  without  a  refrigerator  are  memories  which  can 
never fade! Now I zealously guard 30 species of birds that 
nest in our campus, which is within city limits and despite 
the frantic pace of this century, I have strived to get my 
children to experience these wonders of nature- flora and 
fauna whenever possible. Now that I am based in Gwalior, 
I thought it would be an excellent idea to try wean more 
people away from plastics, chemicals and unhealthy living 
in our chaotic yet historic city- Gwalior!  

EDN  was  happy  to  have  our  17th  century  home  set  in 
25  acres  as  their  venue  to  start  their  Madhya  Pradesh 
activities  and  this  is  how  the  26th  September  Organic 
Mela and Charity Banquet came about. It was a gentle way 
through the press and stalls by organizations dealing with 
food and life style products to remind people that there is 
an alternate choice! 

Guests  came  in  from  Delhi  for  a  day  with  our  excellent 
connection  of  3  hours  and  15  minutes  to  the  capital  via 
Shatabdi train. Starting with a tour of the complex, that 
has  been  my  husband,  Sardar  Dhananjayrao  Jadhav’s 
home,  comprising  of  beautiful  gardens  and  stunning 
architecture.  We  took  the  guests  from  the  Mughal  era 
with the ‘Char Bagh’ and ‘Baradari’ to the Maratha period 
‘chhatris’  of  our  ancestors  and  our  family  temples  and 
then on to buildings like the zenana which were used for 

 
important state meetings during the freedom struggle to a 
 
Spanish style hacienda, which was the former ‘mardana’ 
             
now our home. The zenana, which was converted into a 
community school by my late mother in law Lady Jadhav, 
has  now  been  converted  by  me  into  a  hotel  run  by  the 
Neemrana  group.  Visitors  are  always  amazed  at  how 
five generations of the Jadhav family, one of the big five 
Sardar families of the erstwhile Gwalior state have used 
these premises. Sardar Deorao Bhausaheb Jadhav and his 
son Sardar Krishnarao Deorao Jadhav, father of Maharani 
Sakhya Raja Scindia used this as a garden home for picnics 
with  overnight  halts  occasionally  in  the  zenana  and 
mardana  areas  while  they  continued  to  reside  at  Laxmi 
Vilas Rajwada. Their elephants and stables were housed 
here  too  but  with  India’s  independence  and  merger  of 
states my father in law Sardar Deorao Krishnarao Jadhav 
moved residence to the mardana.

The  piece  de  resistance  was  the  Royal  Organic  Buffet 
served  with  traditional  royal  dishes  made  from  organic 
and  natural  ingredients  provided  entirely  by  Down  to 
Earth and prepared by the cooks of the household. This 
lunch was attended by a large number of diplomats and 
their families and various Indian industrialists and their 
spouses who came from Delhi. It was a major success, as 
most of the guests had never tasted these special dishes.

The banquet at our home could not be termed so without 
serving  Barbat  -  a  mutton  dish  favored  by  the  Maratha 
armies  on  the  march.  It  is  a  typical  regional  dish  where 
meat  is  cooked  in  spicy  gravy  and  we  prepare  this  on 
special festive occasions like Dussehra. Another dish that 
served was Vade Komde - a chicken curry accompanied by 
traditional  savoury  doughnuts,  which  everyone  agreed, 
were  mouth  wateringly  delicious.  For  the  vegetarians 
there  was  Kadai  Bhindi  -  batter  fried  Okra  delicately 
flavored with dry spices, Aloo ka Achar - a tasty potato

Our special rice pulao with cottage cheese balls called Gole 
ka Bhaat was also made. The Chapati is actually traditional 
triangular bread made with flour and oil. Various Farsans 
and Chutneys were presented as side dishes to complement 
the meal. The Mandodari Dal, named after Ravana’s wife, 
is made of lentils cooked with over 20 ingredients. For the 
not  so  adventurous  guests  Varan,  which  is  plain  lentils 
with a dollop of pure ghee, was served. 

Everyone  loved  the  Khamang  Kakdi  -cucumber  salad 
sprinkled  with  peanuts,  fresh  coriander  and  lime  juice. 
Finally the puddings- the all time favourite jalebis, made 
with saffron, flour and sugar fried in ghee and our chef’s 
specialty  phirni-  milk  and  rice  pudding  served  in  clay 
bowls were much loved especially with the foreigners and 
children.  The  special  dimensions  to  this  meal  were  the 
organic ingredients supplied to our doorstep by Down to 
Earth.

Guests took a round of the Mela purchasing, making notes 
and later drove off to see the Gwalior Fort, described as 
‘the pearl among the fortresses of Hind’. By evening it was 
time to say good-bye to our day visitors.

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaSikkimese Cuisine

A Melting Pot of Different Influences

Jashoda Chettri

There is something about Sikkim that makes it different 
from  other  hill  stations.  The  same  can  be  said  about 
Sikkimese cuisine. Sikkimese cuisine is different yet heavily 
influenced  by  cuisines  of  other  regions.  Interestingly, 
Sikkimese food is a perfect example of amalgamation of 
different  communities.  The  three  ethnic  communities 
of  Sikkim-  Bhutias,  Lepchas  and  Nepalis  have  shaped 
the  Sikkimese  cuisine.  Sikkimese  cuisine  has  also  been 
influenced  by  Indian  and  Tibetan  style  of  cooking.  One 
may  find  a  slight  variation  in  the  preparation  but  its 
essence remains the same. For instance, Sikkimese chicken 
curry would be less oily and little runnier than the typical 
chicken curry found in North India. 

Being a self confessed foodie, I consider myself fortunate 
to  have  been  born  in  a  place  where  every  meal  is  sheer 

indulgence.  Sikkim  is  legendary  for  its  peace  and 
hospitality.  For  me  true  hospitality  lies  in  practicing  the 
principle of ‘Atithi Devo Bhava’ (guest is God) in the way 
we treat and feed our guests- lavishly and generously. We, 
Sikkimese are known to indulge our guests in the best of 
food and the popular local drink chhang (alcoholic millet 
beverage). No social occasion is complete without a lavish 
spread  of  local  cuisine.  Sikkimese  cuisine  is  a  unique 
blend  of  vegetarian  and  non-  vegetarian  food  items, 
which  are  not  only  healthy  but  light  on  the  body  too. 
Momos (dumplings) are a good example of healthy food, 
as it contains no oil or artificial colour. After idlis, momos 
could  be  touted  as  the  healthiest  food  item  on  earth.  A 
very  special  feature  of  Sikkimese  cuisine  is  that  most  of 
the food items are procured from nature in lines of farm to 
plate concept. For instance, edible fern with chhurpi (local 

variation of cottage cheese) is a must try for anyone and it 
is an eternal favourite with the local populace along with 
sisnu  ko  jhol(stinging  nettle  soup).  Most  food  items  do 
not require extensive processing but that does not mean 
we  eat  raw  meat  or  vegetables.  The  cooking  method  is 
usually easy and simple. Fermented beans, bamboo shoot, 
gundruk and sinki (made from dried leafy vegetables) also 
give a distinct identity to Sikkimese food. Sel roti (a sweet 
doughnut  like  snack)  made  from  rice  flour  with  Nepali 
style aalu dum is a must try along with zeroh and khaabjay 
(deep fried snack made from refined flour and salt/ sugar).

Non-vegetarian preparations are equally sumptuous. Beef, 
pork, chicken and mutton are used liberally in Sikkimese 
cooking.  Karchi  marchi  (entrails  of  local  goat)  is  to  die 
for  while  pork  pickle  is  what  makes  you  salivate  at  the 
mere thought of it. Beef curry is ideally accompanied by 
piping hot steamed rice. The consumption of meat can be 
attributed to the fact that colder regions are more suited 
for its consumption. Rice is not only limited to regular rice 
but  a  highly  nutritious  rice  preparation  is  the  makai  ko 
chaykhla (maize grits rice). 

The  pyaaz  tamatar  ko  chutney  (onions  and  tomatoes 
cooked with slit green chilies) is to Sikkim what aam kaa 
achaar is to the rest of India. This tangy chutney goes well 

with both rice and rotis. Sikkimese people are primarily 
rice eaters but that does not mean we are averse to flour. 
Rotis are consumed too, though it might not feature very 
regularly in our meals. Phaapar ko roti (buckwheat flour 
pancake)  is  not  only  packed  with  nutrients  but  is  also 
easy  to  make.  Another  must  try  item  in  Sikkim  is  the 
dalley chilly (the round red and green chilies often called 
fireballs for the right reasons). Dalley paste and pickle are 
a hot favourite with both locals and visitors. Unsuspecting 
guests have been tricked to bite into one of those red ones 
only  to  realise  that  they  are  not  cherries.  Dalley  can  be 
super addictive!

Sikkimese people are nature lovers and we live in perfect 
harmony  with  the  nature  and  our  environment.  This  is 
reflected  in  our  eating  habits  too.  People  in  rural  areas 
are  adept  at  identifying  edible  natural  food  items  like 
mushrooms,  ferns,  berries  and  tuber,  roots  and  shoots. 
Sweet potatoes, yam, tapioca (known as tarul locally) are 
some of the favourites, which are best enjoyed with silaam 
ko  chutney  and  Temi  Tea,  the  organic  tea  produced  in 
Temi in South Sikkim. Sikkim has become the first Organic 
State  of  India  with  75,000  hectares  of  agricultural  land 
converted  to  certified  organic  land.  So  come  and  enjoy 
eating the Sikkimese way- the healthy way.

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaFood for the Soul

Arun Budhiraja

K. Bhaskaran Nair is a man of habit. Every morning, just 
after 5am, the 65-year old retired Mathematics professor 
steps out of his house and walks the short distance to the 
celebrated Guruvayoor temple. As is the prescribed norm 
for devotees to shrines in Kerala, he wears a stark-white 
mundu knotted at the waist with another unstitched white 
garment thrown over his bare shoulders. To some it may 
seem  to  be  a  regular  constitutional,  but  for  Bhaskaran 
the  early  morning  visit  to  the  temple  is  a  journey  into 
himself  one,  which  he’s  been  doing  each  day  since  his 
retirement. In many ways, it is merely a continuation of 
a habit inculcated during his childhood, when, more than 
five decades earlier a young Bhaskaran would accompany 
his  grandfather  to  the  temple.  After  the  early  darshan, 
Bhaskaran would delight in the prasadam he would get. 
His favourite was the Trimadhuram, a syrupy and highly 
energizing mash of bananas, coconut, jaggery and honey.

His  grandfather  has  been  gone  a  long  time,  the  temple 
town  of  Guruvayoor  bears  little  resemblance  to  the  tiny 
hamlet  it  was,  but  Bhaskaran’s  love  for  Trimadhuram 
is  intact  and  it  goes  beyond  the  taste.  Today,  Bhaskaran 
understands  the  nuances  of  the  shrine’s  offerings. 
Guruvayoor,  like  all  major  Hindu  temples,  has  a  strict 
method in its rituals and practices that follow an age-old 
code. Offerings and temple food change in accordance to 
season and vary in type in keeping with the time of the 
day. If the Trimadhuram is made early morning, there is a 
sound reason for it. The Trimadhuram, and its companion 
offering Malar, though light in eating, are high in energy 
and hence, form the perfect start to the day. Easy to digest, 
crunchy, yet soft, sweetened with jaggery and honey – the 

104

healthiest sweeteners. There can be no better way to rev 
up  the  human  body  for  the  day’s  work.  Had  the  same 
offerings been consumed in the evening, digestion would 
have been a challenge. 

Cut  to  another  time  of  the  day  and  we  find  the  pattern 
repeated.  Between  11:30am  and  noon,  Guruvayoor  once 
again sees the most appropriate temple food being offered 
to God and later served as prasad to devotees. A variety 
of  paysams  are  offered,  mostly  rice-based  and  rich  in 
nutritious  coconuts,  bananas,  jaggery,  ghee,  cardamom 
powder,  refined  flour  –  the  ingredients,  their  quantity 
and cooking processes changing from paysam to paysam. 
While  this  sumptuous  offering  must  surely  delight  the 
Gods, a clear practical objective is clearly observed: that 
of ensuring devotees a filling prasad at a time that is close 
to lunch. 

This remarkable meeting of the spiritual with the practical 
is witnessed in temples across India. In the region of Braj, 
which is as distinct from Kerala as can be imagined; temple 
food  follows  similar  –  though  not  identical  –  patterns 
of  keeping  up  with  seasons  and  time  patterns  during  a 
day.  While  the  high  energy  giving  makhan-mishri  is  an 
all-season  offering  in  the  Mangala  prahar  prior  to  7am, 
winter has its own charms, such as the Daulat ki Chaat. 
In the latter offering, full cream milk is heated in a heavy 
bottomed pan and once thickened slightly, mishri, elaichi, 
cream  and  kesar  stirred  in.  Most  interestingly,  this  mix 
is left uncovered under the stars on a cold winter night. 
Before dawn, cream of tarter is added and whisked rapidly 
to form mounds of froth. This heavenly mix, also known 
as Nimish, is popular in Varanasi too.  

The  next  time  band  is  the  Shringar  prahar,  lasting  from 
7:30  to  9:30am.  Staple  fare  in  temples  across  North  and 
Central India is the ever-popular peda, which appears in 
a variety of flavours. The main ingredient is khoya, which 
is  based  in  condensed  milk.  An  alternative  appears  in 
Vrindavan’s Radha Raman temple, where the kuliya is a 
popular prasad. The kuliya is a small earthen pot in, which 
the  prasad  is  given.  Milk,  mishri,  elaichi,  pods  of  green 
elaichi  crushed,  kesar  and  pista  come  together  to  form 
a  soft  grainy-textured  sweet,  which  is  eaten  with  one’s 
fingers. A delightful and energy filled way to kick off the 
day.

In  the  Gwala  prahar,  also  called  Madhyahn,  which  lasts 
from 9:30 to about 11am, buttermilk keeps the body cool in 
summer. The Braj region throws up an interesting regional 
variant in winter, called Dhuan Chaach. The earthy, smoky 
flavour keeps buttermilk aficionados in good cheer even 
during  winter  mornings.  Then  there  is  the  Lapsi.  At 
Shrinathji,  in  Nathdwara,  it  is  based  in  thooli  –  cracked 
wheat or dalia. Added to it are milk, water, mishri, elaichi, 
badam,  pista  and  ghee  –  a  heavenly  and  filling  magic 
potion  to  satiate  a  devotee  in  the  morning.  While  it  is 
offered all year round in Nathdwara, down South it is a 
summer offering. In Udupi, it is the Rava Lapsi that holds 
center-stage. 

The  one  prahar  of  the  day  when  God  is  offered  a  truly 
sumptuous  spread  is  the  one  in  the  forenoon.  The  Raj 
Bhog  is  the  main  meal  of  the  day  post,  which  the  deity 
takes an afternoon siesta. Balanced and complete in every 
way, it includes two kinds of vegetables – prepared in a 
way that one is dry and the other has gravy. In the Govind 
Devji temple in Imphal, Manipur, kheer is served with a 
small portion of black rice. The contrasting colours are a 
visual  delight  while  the  complementing  textures  soothe 
the palate. In yet another instance of marrying the spiritual 
with the practical, devotees are served black rice only in 
small quantity as this high protein and carbohydrate food 

is difficult to digest. The best things truly come in small 
quantities! 

The  11:30-12  noon  prahar  also  finds  Guruvayoor  at  its 
delicious best. The Navakam Paysam, Pal Paysam, Palada, 
Erriti  Payasam  and  Paradi  Paysam  add  an  amazing 
dimension to the day. In contrast, the rather plain looking 
ghee  arno  made  in  Puri’s  Jagannath  Temple  surprises  a 
visitor with a burst of orange flavor. Also surprising is the 
same shrine’s namak khichdi. In fact, rice-based offerings 
form the staple for this prahar across temples. Just as there 
are  various  forms  of  khichdi,  there  are  also  many  types 
of bhaats, ranging from the Meva Bhaat and Dahi Bhaat 
made in Braj to Shrinathji’s Aamras Bhaat and Shrikhand 
Bhaat. Given that this is the biggest meal of the day, food 
like dal, kadhi, kashiphal ki subzi all find a place, as do 
different forms of raita and sweets like murabba and fruit 
rasa. 

Given the importance of food in temple life, it comes as 
no surprise that most shrines have anecdotes built around 
Raj bhog food. Take the case of Imphal’s black rice. Deep 
purple rather than black, this was also called ‘forbidden 
rice’ as it was consumed only by Chinese emperors and 
not commoners. 

Another example is Vrindavan’s arbi, prepared in devotion 
of  Krishna’s  favourite  gopi,  Radha,  on  the  occasion  of 
Radha Ashtami, the recipe of this dish is kept a secret by 
the Goswamis. In Mayapur’s Jagannath temple, the Lord is 
said to love katahal (jackfruit) ki subzi. Local oral traditions 
state that once a nearby farmer complained that someone 
from the shrine was stealing his jackfruits at night. He laid 
a trap in his field using wire meshes. The next time he saw 
his jackfruit missing, he found a bit of blue cloth on his 
trap and rushed to the temple. The priests were puzzled 
at  how  Balram’s  blue  dhoti  had  developed  a  tear.  Truly 
mysterious!

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaAt around 4pm, deities are believed to awake from their 
siesta, fresh for the devotees of the evening. First comes 
the  Utthapan  prahar,  which  lasts  till  5:30pm.  This  is 
followed  by  the  Sandhya  bhog,  which  ends  at  6:30pm. 
While  coconuts  are  offered  during  the  Utthapan  prahar, 
sandhya is time for the Lord to savour a refreshing drink, 
especially  if  it  is  summer.  While  the  saunf  sharbat  is 
staple  fare,  aamras  and  aaam  ka  panna  are  also  widely 
offered. Braj has its own specialty in the form of munakka 
sharbat,  made  of  raisins  dried  in  a  special  way.  Equally 
distinct is the phoolon ki thandai made in Varanasi’s Kashi 
Vishwanath  temple.  The  kharbooze  ka  panna,  tarbooz 
ka  panna  and  sattua  are  equally  refreshing  too.  After 
sunset,  the  nature  of  the  offerings  transforms  yet  again. 
Between 6 and 7:45pm, it’s time for sandhya aarti and for 
a snack. Namkeen chana dal in Varanasi, adrak ki bati in 
Braj, crispi kharkhari in Nathdwara and chakuli in Udupi 
delight devotees, possibly as much as they do for the Lord 
himself.

The last prahar of the day is the Shayan bhog, which ends 
at 8:45pm. Offerings are light and are meant to aid smooth 
digestion. High on spices like pepper, this acts as the day’s 
last meal for devotees. Shrinathji has a rich offering at this 
time with food ranging from mirchi ka saag, thapari, leelve 
ki poori, khasa poori and more. Poori and aloo, in different 
variants  are  popular  across  most  of  India.  Kachori  vale 
aloo at the Kashi Vishwanath are matched by Braj’s sookhe 
aloo  ki  subzi. A  day  that  began  with  delicious  offerings 
ends on an equally taste bud-friendly note. 

To those who believe that the proof of the pudding is in the 
eating, when it comes to temple food, it is actually in the 
cooking. After all, food prepared in a temple is first offered 
to the deity to satisfy a hunger that is spiritual. Thus, food 
becomes sanctified prasad. Cooked in enormous quantity, 
it  is  available  for  distribution  to  hordes  at  devotees  at 

106

popular shrines, all of which have long traditions for each 
food item they prepare. Temple food is usually prepared 
by  male  members  of  the  family,  who  care  for  the  deity. 
Preparation  guidelines  are  strict.  Bathing  is  mandatory 
before entering the kitchen. Brahmin cooks normally wear 
a  piece  of  freshly  washed  white  cloth  tied  around  the 
body to facilitate easy movement. Talking while cooking is 
discouraged. Often, a thin mask is worn around the nose 
and mouth to ensure hygiene and purity. 

In the high-speed life of the modern era, it may appear that 
traditional practices associated with temples are gradually 
fading out. But to experience the essence of such practices 
one must travel to rural India and to smaller towns, where 
they  live  on.  Not  just  in  temples  but  in  the  hearts  and 
minds of priests and devotees. This is the soul of India, as 
it has been for hundreds of years.

To  conclude,  a  small  anecdote,  which  captures  the 
devotion  of  selfless  service  to  the  Lord:  Padmanath  Das 
was a sincere, though poor, devotee of Krishna. Each day, 
he would pile white chanas on a plate and offer them to 
the Lord. Once, when he had a few guests, they laughed 
at what he was offering as prasad. Picking up each chana, 
Das  explained  that  one  was  halwa,  another  a  jalebi  and 
a third a rasgulla and so on. To Das, each chana was the 
symbol of a different sweet that he offered the Lord. When 
the guests ate the chanas, the taste they savoured was not 
of a chana but of the sweets Das had mentioned. This is a 
testimony to the emotion that Das felt when he offered the 
chanas, in his heart each being representative of a sweet 
he  could  not  afford.  The  Lord’s  divine  acceptance  was 
signaled in the transformation of the chanas into sweets. 

Truly, food for the soul! 

The Gastronomical Trail of the

Tribal North East India

Ashish Chopra

‘Tribal’ – the word itself generates an immense amount of 
misnomers. Time and again the word has been associated 
with primitive ideas, practices and culture. However, I do 
hope this article is able to break some of the stereotypes. 

certain you will be far happier singing North, South, East 
and West than spewing a mouth-full of syllables! And for 
this particular issue, we will stick to what we call India’s 
Northeast.

It is not easy to be born in India and to be writing about 
food, let alone tribal food. My father was an anthropologist. 
Hence, I accredit my interest in tribes and culture to those 
genes. My trail of tribal food started almost three decades 
ago  when  as  a  child  I  would  accompany  my  late  father 
on many of his field trips to remote corners of Himachal, 
Kashmir and subsequently to the north eastern states. The 
food fabric of these regions became an integral part of my 
gastronomical quests. 

Although a large part of the tribal populace has integrated 
with the mainstream over time and has undergone a sea 
change in lifestyle, what has remained closest to its purist 
form  is  their  cuisine.  As  I  was  exploring  all  of  these,  I 
could also see a gradual unfolding of patterns, common 
threads and designs amongst tribal cuisine of all regions in 
India. In an age of growing animosity and apathy amongst 
human, tribal hospitality is a shining example for all. Their 
festivals,  dance  and  song  are  pulsating  with  power,  joy 
and enthusiasm for life.

Although tribes of the world are differentiated on the basis 
of six primary ethnic groups: Negritos, Pro-Australoids or 
Austrics,  Mongoloids,  Dravidian,  Nordics  and  Western 
Brachycephals,  for  the  sake  of  convenience  we  will 
segregate  them  on  basis  of  the  region  they  inhabit.  I’m 

North East India 
Northeast  India,  the  only  region  that  currently  forms 
a  land  bridge  between  the  Indian  subcontinent  and 
Southeast Asia,  for  me  is  home.  I  am  forever  enthralled 
by  the  brilliance  of  colourful  hand  woven  textiles,  the 
captivating  folk  heritage,  its  non-severed  umbilical  cord 
with nature and most importantly the wonderful variety 
of food that the region comprising eight beautiful states 
of  Arunachal  Pradesh,  Assam,  Meghalaya,  Manipur, 
Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura and Sikkim, has to offer. And 
it is a promise that it will be no less than a spiritual journey 
to walk through the lanes of these hills and discover what 
these people are made of. However, for this occasion, let it 
just be food.

While Indian cuisine has taken the world by storm with 
the ubiquitous curry, tribal cuisine avoids those very items 
that define Indian food: oil and spices. Peculiar, bland, hot, 
aromatic, healthy, fleshy, fatty – yes these adjectives can be 
used all at the same time for a northeastern tribal meal. 
While a meal is incomplete without a steaming platter of 
steamed rice, various green vegetables and predominance 
of meat and fresh water fish is obvious. The most defining 
part of northeastern tribal cuisine is the usage of minimalist 
spice. A chilli or two (enough for sparking the fire), ginger 

107

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiaand garlic, occasionally sesame and some local herbs are 
the ingredients to tickle your taste buds.

Love  for  the  Pungent  and  the  Heat:  Though  each  state 
has their peculiar culinary style, each of them definitely 
has a nose for the pungent aka bamboo shoot, fermented 
soya beans, fermented fish, and fermented meat amongst 
others. Bamboo shoot is used widely as a souring agent 
in almost all the tribes. Dried fish chutney is relished in 
almost every state. People in Tripura love their fermented 
fish preparation called shidal while ngari is a must have 
in  Manipur  (though  Manipur  is  largely  non-tribal;  it 
has a good segment of tribal populace). Fermented soya 
bean  popularly  known  as  akhuni  in  Nagaland,  kinema 
in  Sikkim  and  turumbai  in  Meghalaya,  is  a  significant 
ingredient,  used  to  create  a  pungent  aroma  in  various 
dishes, also used as a pickle. When I say pickle, an array of 
hot chilies is indispensable for me to mention. The world’s 
hottest chilli popularly known as Raja Mircha or the king 
chilli  has  various  names  like  U-morok  in  Manipur  and 
bhoot  jolokia  in Assam  and  is  widely  relished.  None  of 
the pork dishes for example, in a state like Nagaland, is 
complete without the flavour of this fiery chilli. I’d say, if 
you have a brave heart and a desire for fire, just ask for it. 
The variety of chillies found in this region is mind blowing 
– the bird eye chilli known as khud jolokia in Assam, the 
dalle of Sikkim are only the tip of the ‘hot’berg. 

Rice: Rice is fundamental to the cuisine. You have various 
kinds at that; the favourite of them all is the wild sticky 
rice.  Many  a  times  rice  is  prepared  in  hollow  bamboo 
tubes. Apart  from  steaming  the  rice,  they  prepare  them 
like  a  stew.  The  Bodos  of Assam  prepare  a  stew  out  of 
chicken  and  a  rice  powder  called  onla  wangkhrai.  The 
tribes in Meghalaya have a rice preparation called jadoh 
made  out  of  rice  and  pig  liver.  In  Arunachal  Pradesh 
too, like all other  states, rice is consumed at  every  meal 
and has different names; ekayi, tongtep, khautek, porok 
amin, dung poo are a few. Dals and lentils are also staple, 

108

however, the methods of preparation varies. Most of the 
times in the north eastern states, rice will be prepared with 
yam stem, bamboo shoot and other locally grown herbs.

Love  for  the  Meats  and  Fish:  These  tribes  smoke  their 
meat at home over their large kitchen fire, ferment them 
underground,  literally.  Well,  the  same  goes  with  beef, 
chicken,  fish,  snails,  shrimps,  silk  worms,  red  ants  and 
others. And of course it is not just peculiar to the Nagas 
but various other tribes of northeast India. For the tribes 
in Arunachal, killing mithun or the bison is the symbol of 
utmost valour and wealth. And of course eating it!

Like pork, chicken, duck and all other edible flesh, fish is 
also very popular and has variety of ways of preparation. 
Fresh  water  fish  is  barbecued  in  banana  leaves  in 
Meghalaya,  Assam  and  other  states.  Fish  intestines  are 
relished. Many people make mixture of rice powder or a 
handful of steamed rice and fish intestines and prepare a 
delicious preparation out of it. 

Technically Manipur is not a tribe-dominated state, as their 
prime inhabitants, the Maiteis, are staunch Vaishnavaits. 
However,  Manipur  also  has  its  fair  population  of  tribes 
namely the Kukis, Paiteis, Zilliongs etc. Singzu is a salad 
prepared from green vegetables, chick peas and ngari and 
is relished all over the state. 

Not  without  Veggies:  Despite  the  predominance  of 
protein in their cuisine, the people of northeast are heavy 
vegetable consumers as well, given the fact that they are 
grown  naturally  in  abundance.  Nagaland  and  Mizoram 
are  organic  by  legislation!  In  Sikkim  they  ferment  leafy 
vegetables like rayo saag, leaves of mustard, radish and 
cauliflower and sundry it for later consumption. They call 
these preparations gundruk and sinki. Sinki is prepared 
from radish taproot only. And of course, Sikkim is known 
all over for its cottage cheese. The Riyangs of Tripura love 
to cook their vegetables in hollow bamboo over charcoal 
fire. Just imagine the flavour it would exude!

Beverages  in  North  East:  What  do  these  intoxicatingly 
beautiful people do when it comes to intoxication? Why, 
they  brew  their  own  beer  of  course! All  the  tribes  have 
their recipes of brewing rice beer. As it is self explanatory, 
it is brewed from rice. Rice is soaked in water for several 
days to let it ferment. Few intoxication agents are added 
to  give  that  zing.  These  agents  are  mostly  local  herbs. 
In Arunachal,  the  local  rice  beer  is  called  opo  or  apong 
or yu, o or marwah. While in Assam it is called laopani 
or xaaz. Each tribe has their own method of distillation; 
however the raw materials are more or less the same. Most 
of the times, the rice beer is offered to the deities before 
consumption,  and  needless  to  say,  every  celebration  is 
pretty incomplete without serving rice beer.

But  of  course,  we  must  not  forget  that Assam  is  the  tea 
hub  of  the  world.  Though  the  people  involved  in  the 
laborious cultivation are the adivasis who were brought 
by  the  British  planters  some  two  hundred  years  ago 
from  the  Chota  Nagpur  plateau  primarily  the  region  of 
Bihar,  Bengal,  Orissa,  Jharkhand,  Madhya  Pradesh  and 
Chhattisgarh. 

Hence a huge number of Oraon, Mundas, Khariyas, Saoras 
have become completely engrained in the demography of 
Assam  and  follow  not  only  some  of  their  original  food 
habits, but also certain assimilated habits. Black tea which 
the people in Assam call laal saah (literally translated as 
red tea), is mostly consumed with jaggery and is extremely 
popular  in  the  villages.  Towards  the  Northern  part  of 
Arunachal Pradesh lies the great Himalayan range and its 
chill  and  the  mountainous  topography  definitely  makes 
butter tea extremely popular, especially in the districts of 
Tawang, Siang and Kameng.

As I say, it is never enough when it comes to food-be it 
eating, cooking or writing. I still feel a little incapacitated 
because  of  the  fact  that  there  are  several  things,  several 
dishes I had to give a miss because of the extensive subject 

matter.  Considering  the  fact  that  the  northeast  India’s 
demography is tribe dominated, time and space is always 
insufficient to talk of the legends. 

However I would like to share some gastronomical facts of 
some of my favourite North eastern states.

NAGALAND

Nagaland has about sixteen tribes and each has distinctive 
styles  of  cooking  to  offer.  Nagas,  relish  pork  and  beef, 
and many Nagas rear animals to be slaughtered at feasts. 
Mutton  is  not  consumed  at  the  same  scale  and  also  not 
reared  at  home.  They  also  keep  a  stock  of  smoked  and 
salted meat all the round year. 

A very significant feature of Naga food is that, it is very 
(very) hot. Raja chilies (and in a generous quantity), is an 
important (and sometimes the main) ingredient of almost 
all the dishes that they prepare. The spices are kept to the 
least and sometimes might have only salt and chillies. The 
simplicity  and  use  of  freshly  available  herbs,  makes  the 
Naga cuisine very distinct. 

Meat  is  cut  into  large  chunks  and  the  other  spices  used 
include ginger, garlic and mejinga seeds and onions (local 
ones which are again very hot). 

Festivals  all  the  year  round  are  associated  with  crop 
growing. Some festivals are peculiar to a certain tribe, like 
the  Angamis  (residents  of  Kohima),  celebrate  a  festival 
which symbolizes protection of life. This festival involves 
men doing all the chores, right from cooking to washing 
and  cleaning.  They  also  live  in  isolation  from  women. 
They believe this would strengthen the men folk. 

December  sees  celebration  of 
festival 
(Terhunyi),  where  Nagas  eat  beef  and  pork  and  have 
access to unlimited zou (home brewed rice beer). 

the  harvest 

109

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaTuluni,  another  harvest  festival  is  celebrated  by  Semas. 
Semas  are  the  inhabitants  of  Zunheboto  and  Wokha 
districts of Nagaland.

Akhuni (fermented Soya beans), is an important ingredient 
for  their  dishes.  For  the  Lothas,  bamboo  shoot  is  an 
essential ingredient of their dishes.

SIKKIM
Sikkim,  the  Himalayan  Mountain  state  of  India,  is  the 
most  recent  member  among  the  North  Eastern  states. 
Topography of this place is characterized by the presence 
of the most magnificent mountain chain in the world which 
includes  the  Khangchenjunga,  the  world’s  third  highest 
mountain which is worshipped by the local inhabitants as 
the protector deity to their land. 

Sikkim  has  a  cuisine  which  is  influenced  by  the  diverse 
inhabitants of the place. The Lepchas, Bhutia and Nepalese 
who reside here have given a very unique flavour to the 
food of this place.

Rice is the staple food like in the other states of this region. 
Meat  and  dairy  products  are  consumed  when  available. 
Various  fermented  food  and  beverages  are  part  of  their 
dietary intake. 

Gundruk  and  Sinki  are  traditional  fermented  vegetable 
products  prepared  during  winter  when  fresh  perishable 
vegetable  is  in  abundance.  Gundruk  is  a  fermented 
product  of  leafy  vegetable  such  as  rayo  sag,  leaves  of 
mustard,  radish  and  cauliflower.  Sinki  is  prepared  from 
radish  tap  root  only.  Gundruk  and  Sinki  are  sun  dried 
after fermentation and stored for consumption. This can 
be preserved for almost a year, and cooked when ever one 
wants it. Kinema is another fermented preparation (soya 
bean), has a chewy property with unique flavour, usually 
consumed  as  a  main  side-dish  curry  along  with  cooked 
rice in meals.

110

Another interesting preparation is Chhurpi , a traditional 
cottage cheese which gives a texture of a white soft mass 
with  mild  sour  taste.  Momo  is  popular  here  too  and 
prepared in the same way as the other states. Bamboo shoot 
is popular too, both the fermented and unfermented form 
of  bamboo  shoot  is  consumed. A  Nepalese  contribution 
to Sikkim cuisine is Saelroti which is prepared from well-
mixed  fermented  rice  batter,  deep  fried,  ring-shaped, 
elastic,  commonly  consumed  as  confectionery  bread  in 
festival and special occasions. 

Here  unlike  the  other  seven  states  people  do  eat  roti 
(bread) and prepare various types of pickles (achar).

MEGHALAyA

 Meghalaya literally means abode of clouds and being true 
to this it also has the wettest place on earth. The climate 
is pleasant all year round and is an ideal place to spend 
a  holiday.  Shillong,  the  capital  of  this  state  is  known  as 
“Scotland of the East”. The British colonials saw this place 
to have great resemblance with Scotland. And it was their 
place  to  spend  a  vacation  in  India.  But  the  local  food  is 
nothing close to the food served in Scotland.

Three main tribes are Khasi, Garos and Jayantias, and the 
foods  they  prepare  are  similar  to  rest  of  the  North  East 
region. Their favourite meat is pork; mutton and beef are 
not  very  popular.  They  have  some  mouth  watering  fish 
based dishes. Fish cooked in bamboo hollow, fish baked in 
banana leaves are a favourite among the people too. Spices 
and fat are again used sparsely, ginger, garlic, onions and 
green chillies is all that is needs to cook up the dishes from 
here.   

Among the three tribes there is slight variation in the style 
of  cooking.  Garos  use  lots  of  indigenous  soda  in  their 
cooking. Khasis have a liking to fermented fish dishes and 
also pork dishes. 

Apart  from  the  other  Meghalaya  specialty,  what  is 
indispensable is the importance of khwai (betel nut). A day 
for a resident of Meghalaya starts with a mouthful of khwai, 
betel leaf and chemical lime. It is also a vital requirement 
for  all  important  occasions;  in  wedding  ceremonies  the 
groom presents khwai, betel leaf, chemical lime, rice beer 
and new clothes to the eldest female member of the bride’s 
family.  It  is  also  offered  to  guests,  it’s  had  before  meals 
to create more appetite and after meal it said to help in 
digestion. Life here revolves around betel nut. 

In earlier days, when food was offered to a departed soul it 
was believed that it would help the soul in its journey from 
earth to the next world. After the arrival of Christianity, 
these  practices  have  ceased  to  take  place.  Now  Khasis 
prefer  to  have  a  tea  party  or  hold  a  grand  feast  after  a 
funeral.

TRIPURA
Native  people  of  Tripura  have  coexisted  with  migrants 
from Bangladesh and now they are more in number, but 
this  has  not  led  to  the  extinction  of  their  tribal  culture. 
Though  now,  the  tribes  have  started  using  pulses  and 
spices. 

Like the other states, the residents of this state too are not 
patrons of too much spice in food. Though they do like a 
little colour in their food, therefore use turmeric. 

Majority of the tribes still live in the interiors of Tripura 
while the Bengalis reside in the town of Agartala. Tripura 
does love shidal, a fermented fish preparation. Each home 
would  have  a  stock  of  this  fish  close  at  hand.  Shidal  is 
prepared  by  cleaning  the  fish,  adding  salt,  and  mustard 
oil and then it is put away in a clay pot for about a week 
or  till  it  reaches  a  certain  stage  of  pungency.  For  a  non 
native, to relish shidal, would be an acquired taste but for 
the native, shidal is a flavouring agent and also put in a 
number on vegetarian dishes. They like pork, mithun (a 

type of buffalo) and rear these at home.

Food  is  simple,  a  simple  meal  prepared  on  an  ordinary 
day, would be steamed rice, fermented fish (prepared by 
using  only  soda  and  ginger).  Degree  of  difficulty  wise 
almost all the dishes are a breeze. 

MANIPUR

Manipur  claims  to  have  the  most  number  of  dishes  in 
comparison to other North Eastern states. Also the cuisine 
is  the  most  evolved  one,  involving  more  than  the  usual 
boiling,  steaming  and  roasting  for  preparing  meals.  The 
dishes are spicier; require oil for cooking and also require 
more  elaborate  preparation.    Over  the  years,  Manipuri 
cuisine has been able to keep the original flavour of the 
traditional dishes. 

People  of  Manipur  are  mainly  the  Meiteis  and  people 
belonging to the hill tribes. Meteis are devotees of Hindu 
goddess,  Vaishnodevi  and  therefore  red  meat  is  not 
consumed  in  their  festivals.  People  belonging  to  the  hill 
tribes do consume a lot of red meat. Food here thus is also 
guided by ones religion. Meitei women enter the kitchen 
only after taking a bath. 

People of Manipur take pride in displaying their culinary 
skills.  Rightly,  a  typical  Manipuri  thali  could  consist  as 
many as 25-30 items, served on a banana leaf (for the plate) 
and bowls made from folding banana leaves in a certain 
way. Rice is served in centre and the bowls of dishes in a 
semi circle.

 Dishes are mainly various chutneys, lentil, and vegetable 
preparations like ooti, hawai-thongba, bora, kelli-channa, 
eromba,  pakoda  thonba  and  many  more.  Thongba  is  a 
word which is used after many dishes; it means vegetable. 

Chutneys  are  an  important  part  of  their  diet,  singzu,

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiachutney  of  unripe  papaya  and  fermented  fish  is  very 
popular here.  An ordinary meal on a normal day could 
be of three or four items, and it may or may not have fish. 

People of Manipur do like non vegetarian food (especially 
fish) but it is not served on all occasions. Certain occasions 
like  utsavs,  call  for  food  to  be  prepared  by  Brahmins. 
These festivals are also the best time to taste the local food 
(vegetarian). Many of the festivals are similar to festivals 
celebrated in northern and western India. 

MIZORAM
Spread  across  rolling  hills  astride  the  tropic  of  Cancer, 
Mizoram  is  situated  at  a  limb  at  the  southernmost  tip 
of  India’s  North  East.  Historically,  its  landlocked  status 
and  relative  geographical  isolation  from  its  neighbours 
has meant that there has been little outside influence on 
its way of life. While the hordes of invaders that poured 
over the Khyber Pass greatly affected the culture of North 
India,  Mizoram’s  seclusion  has  left  the  native  customs 
relatively intact for centuries. The gastronomic culture has 
therefore  evolved  more  or  less  indigenously  with  some 
contributions from neighbouring Myanmar.

The  word  “Mizo”  is  used  essentially  in  the  context  of 
the  tribes  such  as  the  Lushai,  Hmar,  Paite,  Lakhers  and 
Reangs. Though a distinct common thread runs through 
the culinary habits of these various peoples, certain unique 
dietary preferences remain.

An important determinant of Mizo cuisine had been the 
hunter  gatherer  tradition  of  local  tribes.  The  verdant 
forests that surround most villages offer up a bounty of 
leaves,  roots,  nuts  and  mushrooms  that  provide  cheap 
dietary additions to food grown on the jhums. Women on 
their way to and from the fields keep topping up their em 
(baskets carried on the back with a strap over the head) 
with an assortment of this forest produce and firewood. 

112

In  addition,  many  people  maintain  small  green  patches 
outside their huts. A variety of plants, the tender shoots of 
which regularly harvested are grown in these little kitchen 
gardens. All  these  provide  an  abundance  of  ingredients 
that  are  readily  boiled  together  in  various  combinations 
and eaten with rice to produce simple meals. 

The  vast  local  knowledge  of  edible  forest  produce, 
availability  of  home  grown  vegetables  and  extremely 
simple cooking means that something is always in reach 
for the cooking pot and no one, however poor, goes hungry.

Mizo cooking is characterized principally by the general 
absence of spices. This can perhaps be explained by the 
geographical isolation of the state and the comparatively 
recent  advent  of  British  rule  followed  by  Independence. 
Unlike  many  other  parts  of  India  therefore,  traditional 
spices  have  not  found  their  way  into  the  gastronomic 
culture. Items like cardamom, cloves, pepper and cinnamon 
are therefore almost nonexistent in Mizo cuisine. Variety 
in taste is obtained by the addition of chillies, ginger, salt 
and tumeric besides flavouring of certain leaves and roots. 
Sa um (fermented pork fat) is a frequent addition to many 
vegetable dishes providing taste (odour to the uninitiated 
palate), besides the illusion of meat. This heady brew is 
prepared by boiling down pork fat to near liquidity. The 
concoction is allowed to ferment forming a liquid that is 
used  sparingly  for  months  to  come.  Bekang  (fermented 
soya) is another addition lending flavour to many dishes. 
Drying and smoking of meat and leaves is a major Mizo (if 
not North Eastern) habit. This practice ensures that certain 
food items like dried meat, bamboo shoots and yam leaves 
(bal) are available regardless of the season. The traditional 
Mizo hearth is often therefore anointed with an assortment 
of edible items like corn, yam leaves and chunks of meat 
or game hanging over the fireplace. Smoked pork (vawksa 
rep) is a Mizo favourite, its delicious aroma enjoyed alone, 
unspoiled  by  any  other  addition.  It  is  also  added  to  a 
variety of dishes.

ARUNACHAL PRADESH
Rice  is  the  staple  food  of  all  the  tribes  of  Arunachal 
Pradesh.  Dung  Po  (Steam  Rice)  is  the  most  popular 
version of cooking rice. Two brass utensils are used for this 
purpose. In this part of the world, the myth persist that 
food cooked in a brass utensils are always delicious. On 
the top, the rice is filled with some leaves to secure it from 
scattering as the pot is hollow from beneath and the 2nd 
pot is filled with water to generate steams to cook the rice. 
The cooked rice is wrapped in leaves to serve. Kholam is 
also another popular and unique process of cooking rice. 
In  this  method  a  bamboo  tube  is  used  instead  of  metal 
utensils.  The  rice  is  filled  with  water  in  a  custom  made 
bamboo tube measuring 21/2 feet in height than it is left 
beside the traditional heath with enough heat to cook it. 
Before eating the rice the outer layer of the bamboo tube is 
delicately incised.

Wungwut Ngam .. Chicken with rice powder is a delicious 
method of preparing chicken. The required amount of rice 
is fried till brown and than it is grinded to powder. The 
rice  powder  is  poured  in  the  half  cooked  chicken  with 
all  the  indigenous  ingredients  than  it  is  left  to  boil..The 
most extraordinary tribal cuisine is a soup called PASA, 
it is fish soup prepared from fresh raw fish. The head and 
tail  portion  is  chopped  off.  The  remaining  red  meat  is 
minced and a paste is prepared. All the ingredients like 
garlic,  ginger,  chilly,  makat,  pee  chim  khim,  phoi  hom 
(indigenous scented spice leaves) are grinded to make a 
paste. The paste of the fresh raw fish and spices are mixed 
and flavored with the juice of ooriam (Khumpatt) leaves 
which gives a tint of greenish color to the soup. It is said 
that during war time, tribal soldiers used to prepare this 
soup  instead  of  cooking  food  that  would  have  revealed 
their hideouts. The simple tribal recipes are endless; the 
aforementioned  are  the  most  common  cooking  method 
across the state. However, if one desires to taste the various 

tribal  delicacies,  then  one  has  to  travel  across  the  state 
because every major tribes of the state has many sub-tribes 
and each sub-tribe has different food habits and lifestyle. 

Belief and religion also plays a pivotal role in dictating the 
choice of food.

Food in Arunachal is very easy to prepare and reflects the 
simplicity of the people with the use of minimalistic oil or 
spices.

ASSAM
Well, to begin with, I needed a bit of help. I asked a very 
dear  friend  to  identify  a  few  green  leaves  which  were 
not  laai,  lofa,  paleng,  dhoniya,  podina,  matikanduri, 
maanimuni, dhekia, durun, khutora, narasingha, xoroyoh, 
jilmil and kosu ( these are Assamese names of the various 
popular  green  leafy  vegetables.)  She  wanted  to  give  me 
‘authentic’  information  and  called  up  her  mother  who 
sat with her grandmother on speaker phone to go really 
authentic  to  the  days  when  Assamese  people  actually 
used to have a hundred and one green leaves on the eve 
of  Bohag  Bihu  (festival  of  spring  or  new  life.)  Some  of 
the greens I learnt about were modhusaleng, rohbaghini, 
bonjaluk, xukoloti, pipoli, titabahok, borkosu, xetbhedali, 
bhumloti,  xewali,  keturihalodhi,  mermerilota,  tongloti, 
ghilalota, tengamora, long pasoli, brahmi, kolmou, xuka 
puroi,  monua,  masandari,  ponounua  amongst  several 
others. This is Assamese food; rustic, healthy, bland yet hot 
occasionally. The mouthwatering kosu xaak a.k.a colacacia 
leaves with lots of black pepper leaves your nasal cavity 
drained,  yet  enriches  you  with  a  marvelous  experience! 
If I consider the banana plantain to be one of the greens, 
then its stem known as posola is the next delicacy I have 
to mention. 

Though  we  cannot  categorize  the  Assamese  people  as 
carnivorous,  they  do  have  their  share  of  flesh  for  every 

113

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiaspecial  occasion  be  it  a  duck  roast,  goose  curry,  pigeon 
meat, pork with spinach leaves and bamboo shoot or other 
‘lesser’ meats like chicken! Duck and goose are best cooked 
with kumura or the ash gourd. Also used is posola-the body 
of the banana plantain, as I mentioned earlier. Talking of 
Assamese food to the Assamese and not mentioning fish is 
like commiting hara-kiri or suicide. The blessed land that 
Assam is, the Brahmaputra and its tributaries and various 
other  fresh  water  resources  like  the  pond  (Pukhuri)  at 
your backyard, the paddy fields, the streams and springs 
are endowed with various kinds of delicious fish. Small, 
medium, big, all sizes and shapes are available. Small fish 
like  donikona,  puthi,  bheseli,  randhoni,  kholihona,  misa 
etc., medium sized fish like goroi, magur, kawoi, muwa, 
pabho, bato, tura, botiya, neriya and bigger ones like rou, 
borali, xitol, khoriya, sengeli etc. just tickle your taste buds 
with their umpteen flavours. Maas, as the natives call it are 
caught on jaakoi (straining contraption made of bamboo 
used  in  ponds  and  paddy  fields),  thuha,  khuka,  sepa, 
(bamboo traps placed in paddy fields), boroxi (fish hook) 
or zaal (fishing net). Fish is stored in a bamboo container 
called  khaloi  and  can  be  hung  around  your  waist  while 
fishing.

Maasor  tenga  (sour  fish  curry)  is  the  most  popular 
Assamese  fish  preparation.  Various  souring  agents  like 
ou tenga, thekera, tenga mora, local tomatoes, lemon etc. 
are  used  during  the  preparation  of  the  jool  (thin  curry). 
Minimal  spices  characterize  Assamese  cuisine.  Use  of 
chillies  like  khud  (pinch)/mem  jolokia  (referring  to  the 
spicey  flavour  despite  its  grain  size),  bhut  jolokia  (also 
known  as  Raja  Mircha-world’s  hottest  chilli.)  Pepper  or 
jaluk  is  common  be  it  in  fish  preparations  or  duck  and 
geese. Apart from curries, fish is relished deep fried and 
roasted  on  charcoal  fire.  Small  fish  like  puthi  is  roasted 
and mashed with mustard oil, salt, chopped onions and 
coriander leaves. The rustic cooking and impeccable raw 
flavour is simply out of the world! In Assam anything that 

114

is  mashed  is  called  pitika,  the  most  popular  ones  being 
bengena  (brinjal)  and  aloo  (potato).  All  Assamese  will 
swear by it. Potato is popular and it is customary during 
Magh Bihu (harvest festival) to have sweet potatoes (mitha 
aloo, muwa aloo, kath aloo etc.) while the morning meji 
(a  huge  customary  fire  during  Magh  Bihu)  is  lit.  While 
one mentions Bihu, not mentioning pitha will be criminal. 
Pithas  are  traditional  rice  cakes  prepared  during  the 
festive  season.  Both  sweet  and  salty,  pithas  are  dry  and 
either steamed or roasted while others are fried. Jaggery 
is  the  most  popular  sweetener.  Til  pitha,  gheela  pitha, 
xutuli pitha, sunga pitha, tekelir mukhot diya pitha, paat 
pitha,  muthiya  pitha,  pheni  pitha  are  few  that  I  think 
of. Til pitha is unique considering the fact that it is dry, 
has a black sesame and jaggery filling and looks like an 
oversized cigarette. The best way to consume, following 
the traditional way is by dipping it in ronga saah (literally 
red tea but is actually black tea.) While I am still talking 
about harvest and Magh Bihu-a Bihu that signifies a good 
harvest and of course is signified by having huge feasts. 
You will find all what I have discussed so far, all under one 
roof on a single day and of course much more. 

I have been mentioning duck and geese quite often and 
that’s  because  hanh  (duck)  and  raaz  hanh  (geese)  are 
regarded  delicacies  during  special  ceremonies.  You  can 
say,  they  are  the  ‘turkeys  of  Thanksgiving’.  While  local 
chicken  is  more  popular  for  day  to  day  use.  Gahori 
manxo or pork is the ‘forbidden’ meat and is nevertheless 
consumed by various communities and has different styles 
of preparation. There are some who store the pork in a pit 
while others cook it dry with crunchy spinach leaves.

Some use bamboo shoot or khorisa and make a curry out 
of it. The Ahoms have an old saying that if you did not 
have gahori on Bihu, then you will be born as one in your 
next birth. Probably it came as a mischievous story told to 
children in the families by the older ones and the legend 

spun itself hence forth. Paaro manxo or pigeon meat is also 
a delicacy. Two preparations are most popular-a dry one 
with koldil or the banana flower or a jool (curry) with lots 
of black pepper. As I write this, I am getting hungry by 
the minute, and I am waiting eagerly for my next golden 
chance to run to North East as always.

Ahoms and a few other communities have a tradition of 
consuming eggs of red ants (amlori tup) on Bohag Bihu-
the festival of spring. In fact, the eggs from the big nests 
on  mango  trees  are  the  best  ones  and  believe  me;  the 
boys  in  villages  have  to  undergo  quite  an  ordeal  with 
the red ant formic acid bites! What’s good food without a 
little adventure? However, I hardly see many youngsters 
enthusiastic  enough  to  go  through  the  same  ordeal  of 
celebration these days. Probably there are not many forests 
left to provide such scope. Or for that matter, community 
feasts  have  almost  become  a  redundant  concept.  Some 
people say that the sense of neighbourhood is gradually 
diminishing in Assamese society. 

Paan Tamul

Have I missed anything? Yes, a lot! I am not yet done with 
the  pickles,  tamul  (actually  tamul-pan;  a  combination 
of  beetle  nut  and  the  leaf)  and  the  legendary  xaaz  or 
laupani or the local rice beer. Like all other north eastern 
states,  Assam  also  has  its  traditional  rice  beer.  Various 
communities  call  it  by  various  names  and  with  slight 
change in the distillation process; it gives a little variation 
in the zing. Pithaguti (a cake of several herbs) and rice are 
the prime components all over. 

Here is a my one of favourite Naga pork recipes which I 
would like to share

Ingredients
750 grams pork
Fermented bamboo shoot (1 medium tablespoon)
Roasted red chilli powder (3 tea spoons) or the best option 
is Naga Raja chilli
Pepper  (10-15  flowers);  can  use  grinded  pepper  as  an 
alternative
Ginger (10 grams)
Garlic (5 big cloves)
Salt
Water…one cup..
To make curry paste
Make a paste of ginger and garlic and keep it aside.

Cut  the  bamboo  shoots  into  small  sizes  of  1  cm  each. 
Measure a 1 tablespoon bamboo shoot and keep it aside. 
Use the bamboo-shoot water minimally.

Preparation
Cut the pork into medium sized pieces and place it in a 
cooking pot. Add salt to it and enough water to immerse 
the pork. In a medium-high flame, cook the meat and salt 
for 30 minutes or until the pork is half cooked. Add the 
bamboo-shoot  along  with  its  water  and  stir  the  mixture 
until dry. Add some water and cook the meat until it is 
cooked or the water is almost dry. Add in the ginger and 
garlic paste, pepper (10-15 flowers) and chilli powder and 
stir for about 2-3 minutes. (Make sure there is just enough 
water  in  the  dish  so  that  it  does  not  burn.)  Add  some 
more water and let it boil for another 5 minutes. The curry 
formed should be medium thick. Serve hot with rice.

Thevo  Chu  (  Pork  with  Bamboo  Shoot  -  Angami 
style…Angami is a prominent tribe from Nagaland)

I  hope  you  enjoy  cooking  and  eating  this  as  much  as  I  have 
enjoyed writing it! Bon Appetit.

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiaalmonds and cashew are ground with coconut and other 
Indian spices to make the Parsi curries, which accompany 
the afternoon rice meal in a Parsi home. Nuts and raisins 
are  also  fried  and  sprinkled  over  rice  pulao  and  other 
savory and sweet dishes.

The Parsis were those Persians who fled from the port of 
Hormuz in the Persian Gulf around 936 AD from religious 
persecution by Arab invaders. Food starts the Parsi story 
in India – when Jadi Rana, as told in the Kisseh-e-Sanjan 
narrative, gave a bowl full of milk to the priest who had 
come  to  ask  for  refuge  in  his  kingdom,  the  wise  priest 
carefully stirred in a spoon full of sugar. Thus the Parsis 
would act like ‘Sugar in the Milk’ of India, sweetening and 
strengthening the life of their adopted land while not letting 
it ever overflow. Jadi Rana, impressed by this symbolism 
granted  the  Parsis  refuge  and  freedom  of  worship  and 
life. As  can  be  seen  from  this  myth  and  in  real  life,  the 
Parsis brought from Persia their fondness for a touch of 
sweetness  even  in  their  savory  and  spiced  preparations, 
a preference they discovered, that they even shared with 
their Gujarati neighbours. Khata –Meetha, meaning sweet 
and sour is a term by which Parsis are identified.

What  is  Parsi  food  and  what  are  its  origins?  Food  is 
intimately associated across India with religious identity. 
Food is an offering made as ‘Chasni’ in Parsi fire temples 
and  homes  and  accompanies  prayers.  Zoroastrianism 
gives  great  reverence  to  nature  and  its  manifestations 
in  fruit  and  flower  accompany  all  rituals. A  particularly 
auspicious significance is given to the pomegranate, which 
symbolizes  immortality  and  abundance  and  is  therefore 
always part of the Chasni. 

Fish  is  auspicious,  often  used  today,  symbolically  in 
silver  representations  in  ritual  implements.  Standing  for 
fertility and abundance it is also specially made as ‘Mava 
ni  macchi’,  sweet  meats  in  the  form  of  fish,  which  are 
presented on family occasions of happiness particularly at 
Navjotes and marriages. 

For  the  Zoroastrian,  food  is  sustenance  to  strengthen 
mankind in the battle against evil. There is no fasting or 
abstention,  because  unlike  other  religions  of  India  both 
the  material  and  the  spiritual  are  equally  important  in 
the  Zoroastrian  tradition.  Pain  or  depriving  the  body  of 
nourishment is a sin and fasting is strictly prohibited. In

A Descriptive Account of Parsi Food 

Shernaz Cama & Vanshika Singh

The recent discovery by the general public in India of Parsi 
food is heart - warming and also a sign that Indians are 
now  ready  to  experiment  with  different  aspects  of  their 
country’s  vast  cuisine.  Parsi  culture  is  an  amalgamation 
of East and West; in dress and food influences come from 
their  origins  in  ancient  Persia,  their  links  with  China 

and the strong influences of the Gujarat coast as well as 
European culture. 

The spices used in this food reflect a combination of dry 
fruits  and  nuts  available  abundantly  in  Iran,  with  the 
coconut  and  spices  of  Gujarat  and  Goa.  Dry  fruits  like

this ‘Religion of the Good Life’, food plays an important 
role.  It  is  closely  intertwined  with  the  entire  life  of  the 
Parsi, beginning even before birth.

In  the  8th  month  of  pregnancy  the  Agharni  ceremony, 
performed for the expectant mother, has central to it the 
Agharni  no  ladvo.  Its  conical  form  and  almonds,  dates 
and dry fruits come from the Iranian tradition; the sweet 
ladoo comes from the Indian tradition. This ladvo is fed 
to  unmarried  women  in  the  gathering,  in  the  belief  that 
marriages will quickly follow. 

This ceremony is followed by a typical feast, which will 
include ravo (sweet semolina with rose water flavor), sev 

(sweet  vermicelli  with  dry  fruit),  white  rice  and  modi 
(plain or pure), dal- called tuvar in Gujarati and known as 
arhar across the rest of India. Fish dishes will accompany 
such family gatherings, but a European addition will be 
present in the form of a baked dish or a specially made 
savory pastry with some form of chicken or meat. 

This feasting finds its zenith in the famous Parsi ‘Lagan 
nu Bhonu’. Anyone who has witnessed the rows of white 
linen draped tables, shining green banana leaves, and huge 
silver  serving  dishes  being  carried  to  serve  exquisitely 
dressed  and  bejeweled  ladies  and  gentlemen  at  a  Parsi 
wedding feast understands how important feasting is in 
this culture.  

This  is  one  tradition,  which  believes  that  feasting  not 
fasting  is  the  way  to  appreciate  the  Spenta  (bountiful) 
creation that is, this world. Spread on palm leaves instead 
of plates, with silver cutlery and white linen napkins, this 
feast  can  include  up  to  twenty  dishes  and  will  always 
have the special lamb pulao with dhansak dal.  Made out 
of a combination of up  to eight  types  of dal, it  includes 
vegetables, meat as well as special spices, which create a 
dish unmatched in flavour and subtlety. 

A favourite during this special menu is the Patra ni maachi 
or  green  coconut  chutney  wrapped  with  banana  leaves 
around  steamed  pomfret  fish.  The  chutney  comes  from 
the traditions of the Gujarat coast, while pomfret is a fish 
valued both by the Zoroastrians of India and Iran.

The  death  rites  of  a  Zoroastrian  also  involve  food.  For 
three days after death, the hearth fire is not to be lit and 
the family is to be fed by the neighbours. For these three 
days they observe parhizi or abstinence from any form of 
meat. On the fourth day, when it is believed the soul or 
Urvan has entered paradise or garotheman, a special day 
of feasting is observed. Eggs are ubiquitous in Parsi food 
and the day starts with a poro or Parsi omlette, malido- 
a sweet and bhakra- a sweet fermented with toddy. The 
afternoon meal would include the favourite dishes of the 

departed soul and on this day of charum and dhansak is 
always made. Some believe that this is the reason dhansak 
is always eaten by the family gathering every sunday, in 
order to commemorate ones ancestors. 

Apart  from  life  cycle  rituals,  special  calendar  days 
dedicated to divine beings are also celebrated with food 
and reverence. On the ‘birthday’ of fire- adar mahino, adar 
roj,  each  household  specially  decorates  the  kitchen  with 
images of blessing, made of turmeric and kumkum paste, 
over and on the stove. The six ghanbars or festivals of the 
seasons are occasions where the entire community comes 
together and each area has a specialty dish, prepared on 
huge log fires even today. 

The  Iranian  New  year  falls  on  21st  March,  the  Spring 
Equinox,  symbolizing  the  arrival  of  spring  and  the 
rejuvenation  of  the  land  and  its  offering  of  grain,  fruits 
and  vegetables.  On  this  day,  falooda,  a  rich  milk  drink 
flavored  with  rose  water  is  prepared  for  the  special 
Navroze table set up even today across Iran, Central Asia 
and Parsi homes in India, welcoming the new season with 
a symbolic gathering of the fruits of the earth. Most people 
of  the  Middle  East  are  meat  eaters  and  the  Parsis  never 
could succumb to vegetarianism, even during their sojourn 
in Gujarat, a vegetarian strong hold. No Parsi meal would

once  again  showing  a 
multicultural bias. 

The  preparation  of  Parsi 
food  is  not  simple  in  the 
modern  world,  perhaps 
this  is  what  led  to  the 
creation  across  Gujarat 
and  Bombay  and  later  to 
the  Deccan  and  Karachi,  of  Zoroastrian  Stree  Mandals. 
These were women’s organizations, where for now almost 
one  hundred  years,  special  dishes  such  as  dar  ni  pori, 
date  ghari,  bhakra,  malido  and  other  complex  dishes 
with ingredients which need special treatment and skill, 
have been prepared by women trained in the craft of Parsi 
food. In most Parsi areas or baughs, even today, women 
are  economically  employed  by  personal  sale  of  not  just 
this food but regular Parsi meals or dabbas. These are of 
great help in a demographically aging community, where 
often  there  are  no  young  people  to  help  prepare  food 
for  the  elderly.  The  Ratan  Tata  Institute  (RTI)  and  Parsi 
Amelioration Cooperative (PAC) have become important 
destinations not just for Parsis but for all those in Bombay 
who  enjoy  clean,  freshly  prepared  Parsi  dishes  in  an 
ambience of cheerful hospitality. 

The  RTI  is  a  charitable  enterprise  of  the  Tata  family 
started  by  Sir  Ratan  Tata,  son  of  the  founder,  Jamsetji 
Tata.  Inaugurated in 1929, the RTI celebrated its Platinum 
Jubilee in 2005; 75 years of commitment to help the less

fortunate  and  disadvantaged  women  within  the  Parsi 
community and later all Indian women, by training them 
to  make  special  Parsi  food.  The  goal  is  to  offer  a  life  of 
dignity, which is not dependent on charity.  It has an outlet 
with a huge kitchen on Hughes Road in South Mumbai. 
The organization has Parsi and non-Parsi employees many 
who  have  spent  a  lifetime  working  with  the  RTI.  They 
provide  reasonably  priced  Parsi  meals  to  many  homes 
across Mumbai thus helping the elderly and the infirm. 

At  the  RTI  and  in  Parsi  food  the  menu  seem  unusual 
because the herbs of the Iranian plateau mingle with the 
condiments  of  India  creating  Parsi  Cuisine.  The  Parsis, 
as  stated,  are  an  intercultural  amalgam;  therefore  the 
language too, in the menu is often an amalgamation of two 
languages. A Parsi lamb roast, marinated in dahi (yoghurt) 
and spices was influenced by the English roast meat while 
baked dishes in white sauce and English sweet dishes such 
as the bread and butter pudding, caramel custard, cakes 
and blancmanges became part of Parsi food. The famous 
‘lagan nu custard’, served at weddings is an exotic blend of 
the bland English pudding with dry fruit, eggs, cardamom 
and other rich ingredients.

It  is  speculated  that  Parsi  men  invited  to  a  meal  in  an 
English home (in the early years women did not go out 
much)  would  describe  the  food  to  their  wives  and  thus 
would  result  the  Parsi  version  of  some  famous  English 
dishes.  One  such  was  the  baked  fish  in  béchamel  sauce 
which became the ‘machi no saas’, fish in a tangy white 
sauce, popular at weddings and parties.

relies  a  lot  on  bakery  products.  Historically,  baking  was 
an art, which had Iranian roots but was modified for the 
market by shrewd Parsi enterprise. Manufacturing units 
run by private family businesses came into being with the 
setting up of European ‘factories’ across Gujarat. One such 
family of which the sixth generation continues the baking 
tradition is the Dotivalas of Surat. 

So  many  English  dishes  became  a  part  of  Parsi  cuisine, 
that the classic Parsi cookery book, written by Mehrerbai 
Jamshedji Nusserwanji Wadia, ‘Vivid Vani’, written in two 
volumes during the late 19th century, has a total of 2050 
recipes,  out  of  which  700  are  English.  The  Parsi  ‘estew’ 
is  English  stew,  changed  to  suit  a  palate  more  used  to 
spices. The Parsi ‘cutlace’ is the western cutlet enormously 
changed by the use of spices and enough eggs to make a 
doctor wince. 

Parsi  food  tends  to  be  regarded  as  ‘rich’.  It  is  seen  as  a 
cuisine of the affluent, making use of expensive ingredients, 
dried fruit, apricots and extensive use of meats. However 
cooking for the household is normally simpler but is still 
regarded as a very important component of daily life. 

Irani  food,  which  came  with  the  Zoroastrians  who 
migrated across land in the 19th and early 20th century, 

The  Dotivalas  are  descendants  of  Mr.  Faramji  Pestonji 
Dotivala, who learnt to make breads from Dutch traders. 
The bread he made was fermented with toddy, to prevent 
it  from  spoiling  on  long  sea  journeys.  If  left  unsold,  it 
would become dry, with a light and crispy texture, which 
was sold cheaply to the poor. Faramji innovated making 
small round baked biscuits, which have today become the 
famous  ‘Farmasu  surti  batasa’.  For  over  three  centuries 
the Dotivala biscuits, now identified as Parsi biscuits, have 
included  the  Surti  batasa,  the  Nankhatai,  and  the  Irani 
biscuits. While their forte was fermenting the dough with 
toddy,  a  drink  much  favored  by  Parsis,  introduction  of 
prohibition in Gujarat took away that option. To recreate 
this  crisp  original,  the  Dotiwalas  again  innovated  to  get 
the same result. The light salty version, popular in Irani 
teashops, came to be known as Irani biscuits. Thus, sweet 
and salty Parsi biscuits have pioneered the baked goods 
industry in India.

Irani Cafes, starting out as places where the ordinary man 
could  enjoy  tea  and  brun  maska,  a  special  bun  lavishly 
slathered with butter became meeting places of intellectuals 
and  then  languished  before  their  current  revival.  These 
were  situated  in  triangular  locations  bought  cheaply 
because  such  locations  were  considered  inauspicious  by 
the  local  population.  They  were  sensitive  to  the  Indian 
context and there are often boards and menus stating that 
beef and pork products are not sold on their premises. 

Today the Berry Pulao of Britannia Restaurant is famous, 
while Leopold is a regular gathering place of young back 
packers who come in for their substantial and reasonable 
food.  Britannia,  located  at  Ballard  estate,  is  deliberately 
maintained as a part of the lost British Empire. Mr. Baman 
Kohinoor at 92, personally entertains his customers. Old 

colonial nostalgia, portraits of Queen Elizabeth and three 
flags - Iranian, British and the Indian Tricolour grace its 
walls.  These  flags  epitomize  the  hybrid  culture  of  these 
people. 

Mr.  Kohinoor  in  an  interview  explained  ‘The  Iranian 
flag  represents  my  roots,  the  British  flag  represents  the 
patronage  given  to  the  Parsis  for,  which  reason  we  are 
affluent today and the Indian flag, represents my country’. 

Today an international outcry on social media, accompanies 
even  a  rumour  of  one  of  them  closing  down.  When  the 
famous  Parsi  Dairy  Farm,  seemed  in  danger  of  closing 
down its shutters, thousands appealed to the management, 
while there was an outcry from the community who could 
not imagine life without a Parsi Dairy Mava Kulfi. Kayani

bakery  of  Pune  is  renowned  all  over  the  world  and  its 
famous  shrewsbury  and  ginger  biscuits  are  so  popular 
that only ‘one box for one person’, is a rule. There is no 
question of commercializing or bigger premises, the taste 
and  quality  lie  in  stringent  family  control  and  personal 
care is taken in the making of each product. 

A  young  face,  Anahita  Dhondy,  has  become  the  face  of 
the coming of age of Parsi food as up market, fashionable 
food and a place to be seen in. The Sodabottleopenerwala 
Restaurants,  started  by  the  chain  run  by A.  D.  Singh  of 
Olives, has not only conquered Gurgaon, Delhi, Banglore 
but  has  now  entered  even  the  home  of  Parsi  cooking  - 
Bombay itself. The Restaurant revival is only one part of 
the commercialization of Parsi food.  

Parsis  were  one  of  the  earliest  communities  to  use 
food, not only as a place for philanthropy and women’s 
economic  growth,  but  also  for  commercial  catering.  In 
Bombay  several  dozen  caterers  are  keenly  sought  and  a 
joke in Parsi circles is that the first question on receiving 
a Navjote or Wedding invitation is the question ‘Who is 
going to be the caterer’. In a tiny community these caterers 
are busy during the season September to March and each 
one has adapted to new circumstances by enlarging their 
repertoire of dishes or adding cocktails, serving Coca Cola 

rather than Dukes’ raspberry and grape drink and other 
new innovations. It is interesting that the market is now 
driving Parsi food back to its roots. Several famous Chefs 
are touring Parsi Gujarat and the Deccan to unearth hand 
written recipes and keep one step ahead of the competition.

willing to change and adjust to new circumstances across 
history and geography. Despite this, it is obvious that Parsi 
cuisine is an important marker of ethnic identity. 

Today,  across  the  cities  in  USA  and  Canada,  FEZANA- 
The  Federation  of  Zoroastrian  Anjumans  of  America, 
runs cookery competitions and the more authentic food, 
the  better.  Thus,  Parsi  food  now  spans  the  world  from 
Australia to Alaska and this tiny community celebrates its 
culture with others in the most ancient form of fellowship 
– that of breaking bread together.

Bhicoo  Manekshaw’s 
the  community’s  best-known 
culinary expert, personified within her work and writings 
the varying influences that has created Parsi cuisine. 

While she has received her training in continental cookery, 
she  has  also  done  intensive  research  on  the  history  and 
development of Parsi cuisine by traveling to the heartland 
of  Gujarat  where  a  substantial  majority  of  families  who 
maintain  the  old  traditions  of  Parsi  cooking  reside.  Her 
book,  The  Essential  of  Parsi  Cookery,  (Penguin  Books, 
India, 1996) is a treasure house of recipes and customs that 
define the Parsi way of life. 

Bhicoo  was  brought  up  in  a  traditional  Parsi  home  in 
Bombay, where all customs and traditions were observed 
and  celebrated.  Bhicoo  relates  how  Goan  food  has  been 
incorporated into Parsi cuisine. 

“After coming home from the market, each day, our Goan 
cook  would,  prepare  Goa  curry.  It  would  be  ready  by 
11 am, so that whenever any servant had any time they 
would  go  to  the  kitchen  and  help  themselves  to  it.  This 
Goa curry became a part and parcel of many Parsi homes, 
because children like me were practicably brought up on 
it by our ayahs”.

She  was  told  that 
there was no vacancy 
for  a  year  as  they 
took only ten pupils 
at a time in that Course. Bhicoo asked the Principal if she 
would  just  go  through  the  manuscript  of  her  first  book, 
“Traditional Recipes of India”, which she had just finished 
writing, as she was not sure if it was worth publishing. 

After going through the script, the Principal told her that 
she  should  publish  it  and  asked  her  to  give  a  cookery 
demonstration.  Parsi  cuisine  came  to  the  fore.  Bhicoo 
gave a demonstration of papata ma murghi (chicken with 
potatoes) and kera pur enda (eggs on bananas). She was 
accepted on the course as the eleventh pupil. 

As  Advisor  to  the  India  International  Centre,  Bhicoo 
prepared meals for the highest in the land. Indira Gandhi, 
with  her  Parsi  connections  loved  this  food  as  did  many 
of  the  VVIPs  whom  Bhicoo  served,  showcasing  Indian 
diversity.

Rajasthani Cuisine

Gayatri Singh

Along with its monuments, sculptures and other tangible 
artefacts  of  a  rich  civilization,  ancient  India  developed 
an amazing variety of incomparable cooking techniques.  
Some of the most fascinating originated from the various 
princely states in the area that is today called Rajasthan. 

The Maharajas of these states prided themselves on their 
fine master cooks, their unique foods, their food advisors 
(who  were  considered  to  be  doctors),  and  their  intricate 
methods of cooking.  Prized recipes were closely guarded 
secrets.    The  refined  and  esoteric  recipes  of  the  royal 
courts, however, all grew from a vast store of knowledge 
developed over centuries throughout the region. 

Our  ancient  cooks  operated  under  the  strictures  of  a 
highly sophisticated culinary science.  And it was indeed a 
science.  The basic rules were that similar added to similar 
increases,  while  similar  added  to  its  opposite  reduces. 
Keeping this in mind, six primary tastes were identified: 
sweet,  sour,  salty,  bitter,  pungent,  and  astringent.  Foods 
were further identified by their effect on the body, either 
as heat producing or as cooling. 

Sweets, milk or fruit based recipes, for instance, increase 
mucus  content  and  have  a  cooling  action.  On  the  other 
hand,  ginger,  garlic,  black  pepper  and  chilies  are  heat 
producing. As the summer approached, the food advisors 
would warn against foods that were unwise to consume. 
At all times, they would instruct that some foods would 
be beneficial if eaten during the day, but unwise to take 
(and not digestible) after sunset; indeed, possibly poison 
at  night.  The  rules  were  many  and  precise.  Today  they 
have been confirmed by modern medical science but our 

ancestors knew them long before Google appeared on the 
scene.  

Rich foods predominated in the winter. Breads soaked in 
butter  melted  in  the  mouth  and  were  eaten  after  dainty 
portions of meat, served with raw onions, green chilies and 
lemon. Vegetables were scarce; those that were available 
were  all  grown  locally  and  dried  for  use  throughout 
the  year.  Perhaps  because  of  the  difficulty  of  growing 
vegetables in the desert, meats were plentiful and cooked 
in numerous ways.   

The methods of cooking in ancient Rajasthan were creative, 
adapted to both the climate and the available resources.  
The most common were: 

Clay  Baking.    Foods  were  marinated  and  mixed,  then 
wrapped in muslin cloth, clad with clay and baked in coal. 

Stone Roasting - A flat slab of stone was placed on blazing 
coal. Once hot, it would work as a grill and food placed 
upon it would be roasted. 

Pit  Cooking  -  A  pit  was  dug,  layered  with  wood  and 
blazing coal. Food was placed in the pit and then covered 
with  coal,  leaving  a  “breathing  pipe.”  At  times  grain 
was kneaded into dough and baked in the pit. Food was 
sometimes wrapped in leaves of a particular tree -- such as 
flame of the forest -- or rice was packed in lotus leaves and 
cooked on the top layer of coal. 

Dum  (steaming)  -  Food  would  be  sealed  with  dough; 
ensuring  that  moisture  could  not  escape  and  that  both 
flavour and aroma would be trapped within. 

125

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaBhagar- was a method of enhancing boiled food. Spice was 
added to a few spoons of heated ghee, taking advantage 
of  the  ability  of  ghee  (or  oil)  to  extract  both  aroma  and 
flavour from the spices and herbs. 

Dhungar (smoking) - A few drops of ghee were drizzled 
over a flaming coal and then placed in the dish containing 
the food, which was then tightly covered. The smoke could 
not escape and would permeate the entire dish. 

The origins of the techniques are buried in antiquity, but 
they still survive throughout Rajasthan. In a desert village, 
a clay pot will be broken and a piece of the pottery thrust 
down  into  the  simmering  food,  which  is  then  tightly 
covered. The entire dish will be permeated by a delicate 
smokiness from the piece of clay. 

At  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum,  a  guest  of  the  royal 
family may be served hare that has been encased in pastry 
and cooked in a pit below ground, before being taken out 
and presented as a great delicacy. 

From  these  simple  yet  subtle  techniques,  creativity 
soared into truly fantastic realms. A recipe of which my 
grandmother was especially proud, involved an individual 
baingan (aubergine) plant. 

Apart  from  the  vegetables  hanging  on  the  branches  the 
rest of the plant was covered in clay, each baingan slit and 
stuffed with spices, then roasted while still on the branch. 
Before serving, the clay was washed and guests presented 
with a living plant from, which they could pluck and eat a 
perfectly cooked jewel of a vegetable.

These  things  are  a  strong  and  important  part  of  our 
heritage and should be documented and preserved so that 
we do not lose them.

Food in Vedic Times

Sanjeev Kapur

What did ancient India eat?
A prayer from the Yajurveda:

“May  for  me  prosper,  through  the  sacrifice,  milk,  sap,  ghee, 
honey,  eating  and  drinking  at  the  common  table,  ploughing, 
rains,  conquest,  victory,  wealth,  riches.  May  for  me  prosper, 
through the sacrifice, low-grade food, freedom from hunger, rice, 
barley  sesame,  kidney  beans,  vetches,  wheat,  lentils,  millets, 
panicum grains and wild rice. May for me prosper, through the 
sacrifice, trees, plants, which grows in ploughed land and which 
grows in unploughed land.”

This prayer, composed around 800 BC, gives us a pretty 
good  indication  of  the  food  of  that  period.  It  is  quoted 
from  the  eminent  food  historian  K.T.  Achaya’s  book  on 
Indian food. K.T. Achaya’s books on the history of Indian 
food are nothing less than a treasure house. He gives us a 
rare glimpse into the history and development of Indian 
cuisine. 

Food
It is believed, that the Aryans set the agricultural patterns of 
food production that still prevails in India. The cultivation 
of rice, pulses, beans, peas, wheat, linseed and even hemp 
is mentioned in the Yajurveda, but the Rig Veda does not 
mention rice or wheat, only barley (yava). Thus making 
barley one of the earliest grains known to India.

One  is  curious  to  know  about  the  food  eaten  by  the 
Aryans.  Deductions  about  the  food  of  the  Harappans 
are  made  from  the  archaeological  artifacts  but  there  is 
however, little or no evidence of their cooking habits. On 

the other hand, there are listed evidences of food eaten by 
the Aryans, in the Rig Veda and other books. Barley was 
fried in ghee and fashioned into cakes or fried and then 
dipped in honey. Bengali sweets could trace its lineage to 
this technique. Rice came in later, but went on to dominate 
the food scene. Common accompaniments with rice were 
ghee, curds, pulses or meat. Wheat though not mentioned 
in the Rig Vedas, finds a mention in the Yajurveda and the 
Brahmans. 

Amongst pulses the three prominent ones were urad, mung 
and masur. Rajma too makes an appearance and meat was 
commonly eaten. Ox, goats, birds; buffalo, humped bull 
and sheep were slaughtered for food. Animals were killed 
at ritualistic sacrifices and the meat would then be eaten. 
Dogs,  village  cock,  boar  and  carnivorous  animals  were 
considered  diet  taboos.  The  taboo  was  relented  only  for 
times of distress. However, it should be noted that meat 
eating was encouraged only when there were guests or as 
offering to the gods. 

Barley is one of the oldest grains. Rice came in much later, 
but it quickly found a place of prominence. Meat eating 
was common, but killing of animals other than for eating 
or religious sacrifices, was not encouraged.

Spices and Condiments
Salt was not common in the early Vedic times. Not only 
was  it  a  rarity  but  also  students  and  widows  were  not 
permitted  to  consume  it.  Newly  weds  had  to  abstain 
from salt for the first three days after their marriage. Salt 
was obtained from lakes, rivers, sea, swamps and mines, 

7

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiaand was expensive. The earliest spice was mustard, sour 
citrus,  turmeric  and  long  pepper.  Later  came  in  pepper 
and asafoetida. The spice list isn’t too exhaustive, as the 
Aryans did not favour the use of spices. 

One  of  the  words  for  black  pepper  was  kari.  It  was  a 
vital ingredient in meat dishes; over the centuries kari got 
Anglicized and became curry, applying to wide range of 
seasoned dishes.

Fruits and vegetables
Fruits  were  an  integral  part  of  the  Aryan  diet.  Three 
varieties  of  jujubes,  udumbura  fruit  (Indian  fig)  and 
Saphaka  (trapabispinosa)  were  commonly  eaten,  so 
was the rose apple and mango. Radish and ginger were 
munched  on  after  meals  to  help  in  digestion. As  it  is  in 
some communities even today garlic, onion and leek were 
looked down upon. The Rig Veda mentions the lotus stem, 
cucumber  and  later  lotus  roots,  bottle  gourd,  singhada, 
aquatic  plants,  bitter  gourd,  a  variety  of  methi  for 
flavouring, mahua flowers, yam and other roots. Spinach, 
leafy vegetables, elephant yam (suran) and sweet potato 
are  also  mentioned.  Grapes,  forest  fruits  like  berries  are 
recorded  and  the  newer  fruits  mentioned  are  jackfruits, 
banana, palm, tenduka and several species of citrus fruits. 

Banks of rivers beaten by foam was where pumpkins and 
gourds were cultivated. Areas that were frequently flooded 
were used to grow grapes, long pepper and sugarcane.

Sweets and Desserts
The  earliest  sweetener  was  honey.  A  common  welcome 
drink of those days was madhuparka, a honey sweetened 
concoction  of  curd  and  ghee.  Later  jaggery  and  sugar 
dominated as sweetening agents. Rock sugar was common 
and jaggery became the base for many sweet preparations. 
Many of the sweets made in those times exist even now,

slightly or not modified. In preparations related to dairy 
products there is a mention of payasya (not payasa), which 
was the solid part of curd mixed with boiled milk, crystal 
sugar  and  herbs.  Shirkarini,  the  ancestor  of  present  day 
shrikhand  was  made  out  of  strained  curd,  crystal  sugar 
and spices.

Interestingly the Rig Veda cites honey from smaller bees 
better than the one from bigger bees.

Beverages
Milk was one of the main ingredients in the cuisines of the 
Vedic  period.  Though  cow’s  milk  was  preferred,  buffalo 
and goat milk was also used. Grains were cooked in milk 
to prepare dishes. Other by products of milk like cream 
and  ghee  were  also  used  extensively.  Curd  was  very 
popular  and  the  churning  method  was  used  to  derive 
butter.  Two  varieties  of  cheeses,  porous  and  non-porous 
find  a  mention  in  the  texts. Adults  consumed  solidified 
and clarified butter while children ate fresh butter. 

A popular dairy oriented drink was the rasala, a sweet and 
spicy curd. Speaking of drinks, one cannot have a chapter 
on food of the Vedic period without a mention of Som rasa 
or Soma. It was an exhilarating drink, which was called 
hoama in Iran and Soma in India. Soma was usually offered 
to the gods and consumed by priests during sacrifices. It 
was believed that an individual who consumed Soma was 
fortified beyond his natural abilities. 

The process of extracting the Soma juice was an elaborate 
one. The Soma plant was sprinkled with water and ground 
with a stone on other stones placed above holes that were 
connected  underground,  the  grinding  then  yielded  a 
sound  that  was  similar  to  bellowing  bulls!  The  ground 
paste was collected on a cowhide and strained through a 
sheep’s wool cloth; the sparkling liquid that was obtained 

was  mixed  with  milk,  curd  or  flour  and  consumed. 
However there are no clear leads on what exactly was the 
Soma plant. While drinking Soma was commended, Sura 
was  condemned.  Sura,  was  an  intoxicating  liquor  made 
from fermented barley or wild paddy and was consumed 
more by the Kshatriyas, but there were kings like Asvapati, 
who  proudly  declared  that  there  were  no  drunkards  in 
his kingdom. Parisruta was prepared from flowers or by 
fermenting certain grasses and Kilala was a sweet drink 
made of cereals. Masara, another drink was made of rice 
and spices, allowed to ferment for three days. Water was 
rightly called amrta or nectar.

The Aryans consumed fruit juices from a very early stage. 
Juice of the mango, jamun, banana, grapes, coconut and 
edible water lily were common.

According to the Sutras, hospitality is one of the five duties 
of  the  householder.  Eating  before  offering  to  the  gods, 
brahmans and guests was considered improper. Sacrificial 
priests, father-in-law and a king were considered specially 
deserving of hospitality, but one couldn’t disregard even a 
sudra or a lower born as a guest. Besides these, the smaller 
creatures were also fed. Purity of food and cleanliness while 
preparing food was much stressed upon. Food prepared 
overnight or that, which had gone sour, was considered 
unfit for consumption. Commercially available foods were 
discouraged, especially ones that were flavoured. 

The presence of hair, insects or rat droppings in food was 
not acceptable. Food smelt by humans or animals was not 
eaten and so was food touched by the lower castes. There 
are several rules of etiquette for dining, most of which are 
based on commonsense. Gradually as the Aryans spread 
themselves  all  over  India,  the  entire  country  adapted  to 
their ways of food and life.

Navroz,  is  the  Persian  New  Year,  beginning  on  the  first 
day of the spring , 21st March. Navroz has its origin in the 
time of great kings of ancient Persia. 

The Parsi community in India celebrates the festival in its 
traditional  way.  The  New  Year  means  new  life  to  them. 
This celebration places constant emphasis on the newness 
of  life. About  two  weeks  before  Navroz,  wheat  or  other 
grain  is  sown  in  a  sandy  bed.  By  Navroz  eve  the  green 
shoots  are  well  in  evidence  and  the  clump  is  divided 
according to the number of family members, each tied with 
a colorful ribbon and set on the haft seen (seven S’s) table, 

symbolic of the roots of life. Seven food items beginning 
with an ‘S’ must be placed on the table, the number seven 
probably  relating  to  the  seven  days  of  the  week  or  the 
seven planets of the solar system. The seven items are: Seb 
(apple) Sir(garlic), Sumak (a kind of spice ) Sabzi (herbs) 
Sirka (vinegar), Sikke (coin) and a sweet pudding made 
with wheat called Samanoo. The table would also have a 
bowl of water with a green leaf floating in it, fresh fruit, 
eggs,  meat,  fish,  fowl,  sweetmeat,  pastries,  grains  and

Andhra and Kerala, celebrate Ugadi, the Telugu New Year 
day. Gatherings of the extended family and a sumptuous 
feast  are  the  key  for  the  day.  The  day,  however,  begins 
with  ritual,  showers  (oil  bath)  followed  by  prayers,  and 
then the consumption of a specific mixture of six tastes, 
called  Ugadi  Pachhadi,  comprising  of  neem  buds,  raw 
mango, tamarind juice, green chilli, jaggery, ripe banana 
pieces  and  salt.  Every  member  of  the  family  has  to  eat 
this chutney as a ritual after offering  it to the deity. This 
mixture of different tastes symbolizes the fact that life is 
a  mixture  of  different  experiences  (sadness,  happiness, 
anger, fear, disgust, surprise), which should be accepted 
together and with equanimity.

celebrates  its  most  important  three  day  festival  called 
Onam. According to mythology, this land was home to king 
Mahabali-grandson of Prahlad. This three-day celebration

Although Bengalis are known for their sweet tooth, their 
puja cuisine consists of a number of spicy dishes as well. 
Nonetheless,  they  add  a  tinge  of  sugar  to  some  of  their 
dishes. Some of the Bengali spicy dishes that have gained 
popularity over the years include Chola Dal, Bandhakopar 
Dalna and Aloo Posto. Recipes cooked during Durga Puja 
period have been same over the centuries. On ‘sasthi’ the 
day of ‘bodhon’, vegetarian items are prepared: fruits and 
sweets for the women, rice, curry, dal and sweets for the 
men.  On  ‘saptami’  the  fare  is  non-vegetarian;  rice,  fish, 
cauliflower,  and  sweets  in  the  morning,  and  lobsters, 
mutton and sweets in the evening. The vegetarian recipes 
on ‘ashtami’ are similar to those of ‘sashti’. The recipes of 
‘navami’ are similar to those of ‘sashti’.

Ganpati bappa Morya, Mangal Moorti Morya are sounds 
with drum beats, which fill the whole state of Maharashtra 
during this festival. This annual festival in honour of Shri 
Ganesh or Sri Ganapati has been observed for at least 250 
years, and perhaps since the 12th century. Special prasad 
and  Saatvik  food  (cooked  without  onions  and  garlic) 
are  prepared  to  mark  the  days  of  puja.  Lord  Ganesh  is 
known  for  his  inclination  towards  sweets.  therefore,  a 
festival  dedicated  to  Lord  Ganesha  is  always  celebrated 
with special sweet dishes, like modak and tilgul. Similarly 
rawa ladoo, puranpoli and ullydarai are some of the other 
traditional sweets of the festival.

Guru Purab
India is a secular country and many religions are practiced. 
This is a country where Hindus, Muslim, Christians and 
Sikhs  live  together  and  each  one  of  them  has  complete 
liberty  to  enjoy  and  celebrate  their  own  festivals.  Guru 
Purab, known as the “festival of the Gurus” are the major 
festivals of the Sikhs. 

The  celebrations  of  the  Guru  Purabs  are  marked  by

festival  is  usually  of  three  days,  two  days  before  the 
birthday;  Akhand  Path  (reading  of  Guru  Granth  Sahib, 
the holy book of Sikhs) is practiced. A procession led by 
the  Panj  Pyaras  (Five  Beloved  Ones),carrying  the  Sikh 
flag known as Nishan Sahib and the Paalki (palanquin), 
of  Sri  Guru  Grant  Sahib,  is  organized  one  day  before 
the  birthday.  This  procession  is  accompanied  by  singers 
singing  hymns,  Gatka  teams  (martial  arts)  performing 
ability and art, bands playing devotional tunes, preachers, 
and  innumerous  followers.  The  day  of  the  birthday  is 
started with Asa-di-Var (morning hymns) and other hymns

scripture). Finally, the celebration ends with the serving of 
Langar (community lunch) in which food is served to rich 
and poor people without any discrimination in the name 
of religion, caste or sex.

revolutionary  movement  participated  by  all  religions 
from every part of the country to remove discriminations 
and sectarian coventions. The festivals are also sometimes 
known  as “Prakash  Utsav” which  owes its  origin  to  the 
belief of the Sikhs that Guru Nanak was the one to bring 
enlightment to the world.

Muharram  though  not  a  festival  of  joy,  does  not  lack 
traditional  food  preparations,  which  also  differs  from 
region  to  region.  In  Mumbai,  the  cauldrons  of  khichra 
(lamb cooked with seven grains) cooked on coal fire are 
very inviting and in Hyderabad lagans of qubuli (a fragrant 
aromatic pulao of bengal gram) spread their aroma around. 
Badam ka sherbat and doodh ka sherbat are distributed all 
over in memory of the imams who scarified their lives in

tale  aloo  ka  salan,  which  is  distributed  to  all  after  the 
majlis at imambaras.

Jamai Shasti
A  beautiful  festival  called  ‘Jamai  Shasti’  is  celebrated  in 
Kolkata  which  displays  beautiful  bonding  of  son-in-law 
with  his  in-laws.  The  traditional  festival,  Jamaishasthi, 
originated ages ago as a part of a women’s socio-religious 
duty. The son-in-law is called ‘Jamai’ and ‘Shasti’ means 
sixth, thus the festival is observed on sixth day of shukla 
paksh in Jyestha month of traditional Hindu calendar. This 
popular social custom lays foundation of a strong family 
bonding. All the sons-in-law get a treat from his in-laws 
or ‘Shoshur bari’. The Hindu families all over West Bengal 
celebrate the day. 

A  party  is  organized  the  in-laws  for  their  daughter  and 
her  husband.  Mothers-in-law  cook  special  dishes  and 
invite their daughter and sons-in-law to honor them with 
a  feast  that  essentially  consists  of  Hilsa  fish.  Mother-in-
law performs the ritual in which a plate having six fruits 
is touched with the Jamai’s forehead. The festival plays a 
vital role in bringing the couple especially the son-in-law 
(Jamai) closer to their family thus helps in making family 
ties stronger. Bengalis are famous for their love for food. 
After  performing  the  rituals,  a  small  feast  is  organized. 
The  best  and  favorite  delicacies  of  one’s  son-in-law  are 
prepared.  The  guests  are  then  served  exotic  Bengali 
dishes.  Various  fish  delicacies,  prawn  malaikari  and  the 
most  famous  Bengali  sweet  ‘Sandesh’  are  a  must.  The 
mother-in-law fans her son-in-law with a palm leaf while 
he gorges on his food. 

In short, there is no end to Indian festival one ends and 
other  appears  with  its  own  set  of  delicacies.  It  is  an 
unending  chain.  So  live  life  to  your  best  and  enjoy  the 
festivals with their festivities and delicacies.

the battle of Karbala. In Lucknow, with a majority of shia 
population the scenario has a different color.   

During Muharram all the imambaras big or small are lit 
up and the sound of matam can be heard in every nook 
and  corner  of  the  city.  Nawab  Jiyo,  incharge  of  the  bara 
Imambara in Lucknow, said that during the days of Nawabi 
rule, Muharram was celebrated in great style. Alams and 
patkas for the Muharram procession were ordered much 
in advance. Curtains for Imambaras and veils for the rozas 
were prepared with finest zardozi work.

Besides  decoration  of  Imambaras,  food  also  played  an 
important role in Muharram celebrations. Throughout 10 
days, Nawabs, taluqdars and distinguish personalities of 
Lucknow  received  Tabarruk  from  the  Imambaras  which 
consisted of one small sheermal, 2 khamiri roti, one dish 
of lamb pulao, one bowl of tale aloo ka salan, and 1 handi 
of barfi or a bowl of zarda. 

With the end of feudal days all these practices have come 
to an end except the ordinary tabarruk of sheermal and 

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiafor  purposes  of  faith,  pilgrimage,  trade  and  commerce. 
Like  other  crafts  and  skills,  cuisine  evolved  organically 
over the decades and centuries. We know from travelogues 
of  traders  that  condiments  like  saffron,  a  local  precious 
condiment  with  established  medicinal  properties, 
remained  in  use  in  cooking  since  medieval  period  from 
around  10th  century  and  also  found  its  way  into  the 
cuisines of other regions.

Kashmiri cooking and culinary craftsmanship evolved as 
separate entities for Kashmiri Pandits and Muslims. Both 
may  favor  mutton  largely,  but  are  generally  different  in 
the way these are cooked and served. Unlike many other 
parts  of  the  sub-continent,  Kashmiri  Pandits  who  call 
themselves Brahmins, have been great mutton eaters like 
Kashmiri Muslims. Pandit cuisine uses dried ginger and 
asafoetida generously, while Muslim cookery uses onions 
and  garlic.  Another  basic  determinant  of  these  separate 
cooking practices has been use of hing mixed with curd 
by  pundits  and  shallot  mixed  with  garlic  by  Muslims. 
Mach (meat balls), kaeli (a yellow lamb or paneer gravy) 
and roganjosh (a spicy gravy with lamb chunks) form the 
essence of Pandit cookery. Pandit cooking is based on the 
gregarious  use  of  Kashmiri  red  chilli  powder,  tumeric 
and  saunf.  The  recipes  extract  their  wondrous  aroma 

from  green  and  black  cardamom,  cinnamon  and  clove 
and Kashmiri zeera or shah zeera straight from the Valley 
that  lends  these  dishes  a  divine  taste.  Mutton,  the  basic 
ingredient, remains common to both the cuisines. Pandits 
do have vegetarian feasts as well but the vegetarian meal 
is  always  a  poor  cousin.  One  specialty  relished  in  both 
non  vegetarian  and  vegetarian  pandit  cuisine  is  nadroo, 
the locally grown lotus stem cooked in curd with another 
variant of deep fried thinly sliced pieces of the lotus stem.

The  lead  cuisine  of  Muslims  is  known  as  Wazawan. As 
mentioned, Muslim cuisine has been greatly influenced by 
traders and travelers who during their sojourn in Kashmir, 
carried  cooks  as  part  of  their  entourage.  The  visitors 
transacted with local community and joined in the feasting 
which, in the process resulted in transfer of recipes as well. 
Thus, Armenian, Andalusian, Afghan and Iranian dishes 
crept in with some modification and became part of the 
Muslim cuisine. The Wazwan is a family craft transferred 
from  father  to  son,  mostly  by  way  of  apprenticeship.  It 
is an art form still practiced by the professional cooking 
families known as Wazas. The processing of raw material 
involves  converting  meat  into  raw  materials  for  various 
dishes by use of mince, pounded or finally cut pieces of 
mutton.These Wazas also claim that they are descendents

Kashmir Cuisine - A Treasure Trove

Saleem Beg

Cuisine  is  primarily  rooted  in  the  tradition,  climate,  as 
also in the availability of base materials and ingredients. 
However,  it  is  also  one  of  those  cultural  manifestations 
that have remained open to the influences from outside. 
Located  at  the  cross  roads  of  the  subcontinent  ,  Central 
and Middle Asia with borders stretching from Russia to 
Afghanistan,  Kashmir  has  been  called  a  melting  pot  of 

cultures, a crucible of thoughts and influences. Trade or 
transit  revealed  itself  as  a  social  act  that  inspired  allied 
cultural  processes  as  well.  Along  with  merchandise, 
traders of the yore brought along their living traditions of 
costumes,  life  styles  and  above  all,  the  cuisine.  Kashmir 
for reasons of history and geography has received these 
outside influences through caravans and traders visiting 

20

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indianormally  extending  over  a  week.  Traditionally  feasting 
and community meals is part of the celebrations. Muslims, 
mainly residing around these hospices abstain from eating 
non vegetarian food in any form. The Muslim cooks and 
the wazas, have therefore created a vegetarian cuisine for 
the  occasion  of  the  Urs  that  is  served  during  the  week. 
The multiple dishes, all based on vegetables, have names 
mostly akin to the non vegetarian dishes. As mentioned 
earlier, mutton is the otherwise the source and basis for 
the Muslim cuisine.

both  the  cuisines.  The  traditional  Kashmir  food  receives 
heat on two sides, top and bottom and the best results are 
obtained by using charcoal fire.

Cuisine  has  also  followed  and  catered  to  religious 
observances  and  practices  linked  to  the  faith.  Kashmiri 
cuisine  has  thus  adjusted  itself  and  catered  to  the  local 
spiritual  traditions.  Kashmir  has  the  distinction  of 
following a syncretic belief known as the Rishi philosophy. 
Rishis - the local saints, mostly drawn from rural Kashmir 
and  men  of  religion  owe  their  allegiance  to  the  patron 
Saint of Kashmir- Sheikh Noorudin Wali. Sheikh is a 15th 
Century  Rishi  who  propagated  monotheism,  equality  of 
all human beings before the Almighty, sanctity of living 
beings  and  respect  for  diversity.  Sheikh  in  his  poetic 
rendition  called  shruks,  mentioned  that,  he  has  drawn 
his spiritual prowess from the Lal Ded, a Shaivite yogini 
who  was  a  contemporary  of  the  Sheikh.  Besides  an 
elaborate set of teachings, he also abstained from eating 
all kinds of non vegetarian food and did not approve of 
slaughtering of animals. His followers spread the message 
and  teachings  of  the  Sheikh  throughout  Kashmir.  They 
established hospices in different parts of Kashmir where 
annual  festival  or  Urs  were  celebrated  on  fixed  days, 

of master chefs who migrated from Samarkand and parts 
of Central Asia at the beginning of 15th century with the 
influx  that  continued  during  the  following  centuries  as 
well. Wazawan, the field of delicacies has been extended 
to a range comprising of 36 courses. These delicacies are 
generally cooked at night under the expert supervision of 
Wazas assisted by retinue of wazas . Muslim cuisine is a 
gourmet, a trove of exotica to savour.

Pandits, while retaining the basic character of their cuisine 
also tried their hand on the exotica. A specific example of 
this phenomena would be soft ribs from mutton known as 
tabakmaz in Wazwan and Kabargah in the pandit cuisine. 
The method of preparation remains exactly the same for 
this  dish.  Incidentally  this  preparation  seems  to  have 
travelled from Kazakhstan where it is known by its pandit 
name- Kabargah. Over the years, condiments and spices 
took  a  `similar  color  and  the  same  spices  were  used  by 

22

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaIt is worth mention, that the interesting difference between 
the two cuisines is, that they are served differently. In the 
case of Kashmiri Pandits, the food is served in a much more 
informal manner and remains available for hours together. 
The Muslim cuisine is served in a more formal way. Muslim 
feasts are more orderly and follow a discipline and a set 
plan. In these feasts, food is served in a large tin plated and 
carved copper plate known as trami. The guests sit on the 
floor and once the dastarkhan - printed or white cloth is 
laid on ground in a carpeted space of a dewan khana or as 
the practice is now, in a profusely decorated shamiyana or 
tent, the guests group themselves in fours. A mobile wash 
basin  made  of  copper  with  intricate  carving  known  as 
Tash-i-nari is taken around by attendants so that guests can 
wash their hands to enable them to eat with fingers. The 
trami, covered with a copper cover, a sarposh, is served 
to each group. The trami has boiled rice with finely laid 
out items like kababs, meath, tabak maz, saffron chicken, 
etc. Once the tramis are laid for the whole majlis, sarposh 
is removed from the trami and guests are then expected 
to start enjoying the feast. The cook then enters to serve 
dishes, one by one in a sequence that has not changed since 
perhaps when these dishes got introduced in the menu.

There are seven standard dishes that are must for Wazawan. 

These  are  rista,  rogan  josh,  dhania  kurma,  paneer  with 
tomato, mirchi korma, aab ghosh and gushtaba. At least 
two to three vegetables are also now part of the serving and 
these vegetable are cooked in the mutton gravy. Gushtaba- 
pounded  mutton  balls  cooked  in  processed  curd,  is  the 
final  dish  announcing  the  completion  of  servings.  Curd 
is  served  with  each  trami  along  with  accompanying 
chutneys  made  out  of  vegetables  and  seeds  like  radish, 
zirish, pumpkin etc. These accompaniments, an essential 
part  of  the  feast,  do  not  somehow  find  mention  in  the 
writings about the cuisine. Some of these accompaniments 
are zerish chetin- a chutney made of small black berry and 
tamarind pulp, red chilli powder, black pepper and salt. 
Other chutneys, are made out of onion. The gand chetin, 
pumpkin chetin are made of softened pumpkin with curd 
and honey, almond based chutney and sliced radish. These 
accompaniments are meant to neutralize the taste of one 
dish to enable the guest to appreciate and savour another 
dish.

Thus, KashmirI cuisine is a fine art that has evolved into 
an  elaborate  spread  by  integrating  local  techniques  and 
traditional  knowledge  with  influences  received  through 
interaction  by  way  of  trade,  commerce,  literary  and 
religious interactions.

Some Pathare Prabhu Recepies

Chitkala Kirtikar

Mumbai  today  is  the  hometown  to  people  of  almost  all 
the castes and communities that comprise our nation and 
to a large expatriate population. But who are its original 
inhabitants? The Kolis of course: the fishing community 
that dotted the seven islands of Mumbai from its Southern 
tip around today’s Cuffe Parade to the Northern reaches 
of  Vasai  &  Virar.  After  the  Kolis  came  the  Zoroastrian 
Parsees,  around  the  8th  Century  A.D.,  fleeing  from  the 
alien invaders of Persia. Then came the Pathare Prabhus 
(PPs)  in  the  13th  Century.  The  Prabhus  had  a  long  oral 
history  going  back  to  Lord  Ram  and  his  descendant 
Ashvapati  from  whom  they  claimed  their  own  descent. 
King Ashvapati ruled over areas around Nepal and Bihar 
and his descendants moved South and West looking for 
greener  pastures  until  in  the  13th  Century,  they  settled 
along the coast around the area that is today the country’s 
commercial  capital.  The  Prabhus  were  warriors  but  set 
great store by reading and writing and were also known 
to  be  good  account  and  document  keepers,  knowledge 

skills  that  they  carried  forward  into  the  eighteenth  and 
nineteenth centuries. With the coming of the British, the 
Pathare  Prabhus  came  into  their  own  in  the  courts  and 
offices as lawyers, solicitors, karkuns, accountants as well 
as property owners, educationists and doctors. They were 
a wealthy community, owning mainly urban land around 
the growing city of Bombay and in the nearby hill stations 
of Matheran, Khandala, Lonavla as well as the extensive 
salt pans and agricultural lands that they leased out for 
cultivation. They were not only wealthy, but also forward 
looking.  They  brought  up  their  children,  both  girls  and 
boys, to be well educated and ambitious. They were fun 
loving, lived and dressed and ate well and competed with 
the Parsees in adopting a westernized outlook and manner. 
They  started  sending  their  boys  to  London  to  become 
barristers and doctors. The girls were encouraged to learn 
music, poetry, riding, singing and to acquire professional 
training as doctors, lawyers, educationists and writers.

Another  area  in  which  the  Pathare  Prabhus 
excelled was in their cuisine. Having come to rest 
finally  near  the  coast,  they  developed  a  cuisine 
strong in sea food, coconut, cashew, bananas and 
other products of the coastal area around Bombay. 
In addition to the traditional methods of cooking, 
they  acquired  from  the  Parsees  and  the  British, 
the art of baking.

The documented history of my own family goes 
back  to  1811  when  my  ancestors,  Wasudev  and 
Jagannath Kirtikar, bought 104 acres of land for 
the  pricely  sum  of  Rs.600  from  the  Collector  of 
Land Revenue, Salsette in present day Bhayander,

used to be always packed and ready and she would be off 
visiting  family  and  friends  or  places  of  pilgrimage  with 
her faithful Bhagabai in tow, rations, kerosene stove, etc, 
neatly stowed in the trunks. At such times we missed her 
cooking and awaited her return eagerly. I give below some 
of her recipes, packaged as a menu for a generous meal for 
4 to 5 persons. It consists of 2 vegetables, 2 non-vegetarian 
recipes, rice, a sweet and accompaniments. I have selected 
simple recipes, easy to make with local ingredients readily 
available. More complicated recipes, with crabs, lobsters, 
rarely  found  ingredients  and  vegetables  can  be  made 
available  on  request/demand!  PP  garam  masala,  known 
as gode masala, adds a lot of zing and zest to vegetarian 
preparations - can be supplied on request. Excellent recipes 
for  snacks,  using  mincemeat,  eggs,  potatoes,  cabbage, 
green peas, etc, and fish preparations using coconut and 
kokum, are also available.

I have added a rice khichadi recipe with its coconut curry 
accompaniment.  The  Pathare  Prabhus  are  fond  of  hot, 
spicy food, made in generous amounts of oil or ghee. If 
you  find  the  chillies  too  much,  you  might  reduce  the 
quantities.  But  the  oil  should  not  be  reduced,  otherwise 
the taste will be un-PP like.

a suburb of Mumbai, for the purpose of salt panning. The 
original  documents  of  the  sale  deed  are  available  with 
the  Director  of  Archives,  Govt.  of  Maharashtra.  I  have 
a copy of the document, the original of which is on silk 
parchment. The salt pans still exist in almost their original 
condition. Wasudev and Jagannath Kirtikar, I suspect, did 
not expend their own energies in the arduous process of 
salt  panning,  but  employed  others  for  carrying  out  the 
job.  Their  children  and  grand  children  entered  the  legal 
profession. The Kirtikar Law Library within the precincts 
of the High Court of Judicature in Mumbai is named after 
the  son  of  Jagannath.  One  of  their  descendants,  Vaman, 
my grandfather, was sent off to London in 1911 to read for 
the bar, but not before having been first married off safely 
to a Pathare Prabhu bride, Sumati Kothare. He returned 
loyally to his bride a couple of years later and they settled

Paplet Che Bhujaney (Pomfret Curry)
Do not use fresh water fish. It does not suit this recipe.

Ingredients

Pomfret 

Two whole, cleaned, sliced, head & 
tail preserved.

Onion 

Garlic 

2 medium, chopped fine.

10 pods, ground into a paste.

Green chilies

6 to 8, sliced lengthwise.

Coriander 
leaves

One small bunch, cleaned and 
chopped.

Haldi 

½ teaspoon.

Red chilli 
powder 

3 teaspoon (use Kashmiri chili 
powder for its colour)

Salt 

Oil 

to taste.

At least 4 tbsp. Use ground nut oil for 
best results. Sunflower oil will do.

Method 
In a thick bottomed pan, preferably brass, add the chopped 
onion,  garlic  paste,  slit  green  chilies,  coriander  leaves, 
haldi, red chilly powder and salt. Using your finger tips, 
crush  well  together  so  that  the  juices  of  the  ingredients 
start  to  flow  out  and  meld  together.  The  salt  helps  this 
process.  Then  add  the  oil.  I  would  personally  use  more 
oil than suggested here as it imparts a good texture to the 
finished dish. Add about ½ katori of water and place on a 
low flame. The water will start to bubble. Immediately slip 
in the slices of pomfret. Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes, turning 
over the slices once so that they are evenly coated with the 
oil and spices. Serve immediately with plain fluffy rice.

Tajle Double T (lamb)
Mutton  was  always  known  as  Double  T  at  home.  The 
following is a dry preparation that goes well with rotis and 
phulkas, accompanied by the carrot salad, the recipe for 
which is given below.

Ingredients
Mutton	

Small round 
potatoes
Small onions
Coriander leaves

Ginger 
Cinnamon
Cloves 
Black pepper corns
Dhania powder 
Red chilly powder
Asafoetida (heeng)
Salt 
Oil 

Mostly boneless from the 
shoulder, ½ Kg, cut  into bite 
sized cubes. A few bones will do.
¼ Kg, peeled and washed.

¼ Kg, peeled and washed. 
A small bunch, cleaned and 
chopped.
A small piece, slivered.
A 1½” long piece.
5 to 6.
6 to 8.
1½ tsp.
2 tsp.
1/3 tsp.
to taste.
1/3 katori.

Method 
Thoroughly wash the mutton under running water. Place 
in  a  colander.  Place  the  colander  in  a  larger  pan  with  a 
little water at the bottom and cover. The idea is to cook the 
mutton without immersing it in water. Cook the mutton 
for 50 to 60 minutes until almost tender, but not yet tender 
enough  to  eat.  Alternatively,  you  can  pressurize  it  in  a 
pressure cooker. But do not allow it to become too tender.

In a Kadhai, preferably an iron one, add the oil and place on 
a medium flame. When the oil is warm, add the cinnamon, 

27

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiathe pepper corns, and the cloves. Do not fry or saute. Then 
add  the  steamed  mutton,  the  potatoes,  ginger,  dhania 
powder, heeng and salt. Do not cover. You can add a little 
of the water left over from the steaming if required. Let 
the ingredients cook and blend, turning them over once 
in a while so that the salt and spices are evenly absorbed. 
Once the potatoes start to soften, add the onions and red 
chilly powder. Keep sprinkling a little water and turning 
over once in a while until the potatoes and the mutton are 
soft  enough  to  eat  and  the  onions  are  well  done.  If  you 
use sufficient oil, and an iron Kadhai, (as was done by my 
grandmother),  the  spices  and  the  ingredients  will  blend 
beautifully and start browning, at the same time retaining 
their succulence. In the last few seconds of cooking add 
the chopped coriander and blend in nicely. Enjoy.

28

and the methidana powder. Do not allow to brown. Add 
the potatoes, haldi, chilly powder and salt. Turn well so 
that the potatoes are well coated with the oil and spices. 
Add 1½ katoris of water. Allow to simmer, covering for 
the  first  5  minutes.  Continue  to  simmer,  open,  until  the 
potatoes are well cooked, adding a little more water at a 
time if required. One the potatoes are tender add the juice 
of  1  lemon.  If  using  dried  kokum,  soak  the  kokum  in  a 
few  spoonful  of  water  and  add  this  (kokum  and  water) 
to the simmering potatoes. Allow to simmer for a couple 
of minutes more. This is not a dry preparation. A little bit 
of moisture will remain once the potatoes are done. The 
resulting dish looks colourful and appetizing and smells 
heavenly. Use Kashmiri chilly powder and good quality 
haldi for that appealing and appetizing look!

Purnache	Bhende	(Stuffed	Bhindi)
Ingredients
Bhindi 
Onions 
Green chillies

½ Kg.
2 medium, chopped fine.
4 to 8, depending on your taste, cut 
fine.
4 tbsp.
½ tsp
1/3 tsp.
2 tsp.
1  small  bunch,  cleaned  and

2 to 3 tbs.

to taste.
1/3 Katori.

Besan
Ajwain
Haldi powder
Red chilly powder
Coriander leaves

Fresh coconut 
grated
Salt
Oil

Method:
Wash bhindi thoroughly and top and tail. Cut each into 
2 pieces. Then slit each piece lengthwise, twice, from the 

top, and half way down, so that you can stuff the besan 
masala into each piece. Keep aside.

Prepare the besan masala by mixing together the besan, 
cut onions, green chillies, ajwain, haldi powder, red chilly 
powder,  salt  and  half  the  coriander  leaves.  Add  a  little 
water  so  that  the  besan  coheres.  Stuff  each  piece  of  the 
cut  bhindi  with  this  masala.  If  some  masala  is  left  over, 
reserve.

Place a flat bottomed pan on a medium flame and add the 
oil to it. When the oil is hot, add the stuffed bhindi to it. 
Lower flame. Sprinkle with water and cover for not more 
than  3  minutes.  Remove  the  cover,  add  the  remaining 
besan masala, if any, and allow the bhindi to cook in its 
own  moisture  on  a  low  flame.  Once  the  bhindi  is  soft, 
turn up the flame and brown the bhindi slightly, without 
burning or overcooking it. Turn off the flame and add the 
reserved coriander leaves and grated coconut to the bhindi 
blending them in. The bhindi is ready to eat. This goes well 
with puris and phulkas.

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaGramflour (Besan)
Haldi 
Asafoetida
Salt
Sugar 
Thick Coconut milk
Oil

1 tsp.
¼ tsp.
A pinch.
To taste.
1 tsp.
200 ml.
3 tsp.

Method
Dissolve  the  besan  in  2  tablespoons  of  warmed  coconut 
milk and ensure that all lumps blend and dissolve. Pour in 
the rest of the coconut milk, alongwith the haldi. Mix well. 
Reserve. Heat oil in a cooking pan. Add asafoetida, chillies 
and the chopped onion. Saute until the onion has softened. 
Add the pineapple pieces, the halved cashew nuts and a 
few tbsp of water and cook until the pineapple is tender 
but firm. Now add the coconut milk mixture to the pan, 
stirring continuously for 4-5 minutes. This will ensure that 
no lumps are formed and that the coconut milk does not 
curdle. Lower the heat, add the salt and sugar. Simmer the 
curry for another 2-3 minutes. Serve hot with plain rice. 

Khichadi  
(Rice with peas, onions and spices)
This  Khichadi  can  be  had  by  itself  or  with  papad  and  a 
tomato and onion kachumar. It goes well with Naralache 
Sheere, the recipe for which is also given below. But, when 
creating a menu with the recipes for fish, mutton and the 
vegetables given earlier, make plain fluffy rice to go with it.

Ingredients
Rice

Fresh Green peas
Onions

1  Katori,  washed  and  soaked  in 
water for 1 hour.
1/3 Katori.
3 Medium, washed peeled and cut 
into roundels.

Coriander leaves

Cinnamon
Pepper corns
Cloves 
Red chilly powder
Ghee
Salt

small  bunch,  washed  and 

1 
chopped.
A 1” piece.
6
4 to 5
1½ tsp.
¼ Katori.
To taste.

Method
To a pressure cooker add the ghee and place on the flame. 
As the ghee starts to melt, add the cinnamon, cloves and 
peppercorns.  As  soon  as  these  begin  to  sizzle,  add  the 
onion roundels and half of the salt. Turn up the flame to 
high and sauté the onions until they are partly softened. 
Do not brown. Lower flame. Add the rice, green peas, the 
remaining salt and red chilly powder. Keep turning over 
this mixture until the rice is nicely coated with the ghee 
(about 1 minute). Add the chopped coriander and mix in. 
Now add water. I normally add water by what is known 
as “andaz”: 2½ katoris of water should do. The rice should 
be submerged, about ¾” under water. Cover with pressure 
lid, keep the flame on high and wait until the first whistle 
goes. Turn off the flame. Do not open immediately. Wait 
until the steam has been absorbed. Serve and eat hot. This 
Khichadi has a delicious aroma and a lovely honey brown 
colour.

Naralache Sheere (Coconut milk curry)
I ought to explain at the outset that the way coconut milk 
was  extracted  by  my  grandmother  was  a  laborious  one 
and involved first selecting a coconut, shaking it to ensure 
it had a good quantity of water inside (the sign of a good 
coconut), then breaking it open, saving the coconut water 
(or  drinking  it  right  away),  then  scraping  out  the  white 
flesh which was then ground on a stone using a little warm 

water.  The  milk  of  the  ground  flesh  was  then  squeezed 
out  into  a  container  with  your  bare  hands.  This  process 
was repeated twice using a separate container each time 
until the coconut flesh had given up all its delicious milk 
and  was  reduced  to  dry  chaff.  This  milk  of  3  different 
consistencies in the 3 different containers, was then used 
for different purposes, including making curry. The daily 
help who arrived in the morning was well attuned to this 
task  and  carried  it  out  cheerfully.  To  make  things  easy, 
you can use coconut milk powder. I find that the Maggi 
coconut powder is nearest to the taste of the original.

Ingredients
Onions
Tomatoes
Green chillies
Coriander leaves

2 medium, chopped fine.
2 medium chopped fine.
4, cut into 3 pieces each.
1  medium  sized  bunch,  cleaned 
and chopped.

The milk of one coconut or a 100 gm packet of coconut 
powder mixed smoothly into 3 katoris of water.
Haldi
Red chilly powder
Salt
Sugar

¼ tsp.
1 tsp.
To taste.
A pinch if desired.

Method
In  a  thick  bottomed  deep  pan  mix  together  the  onions, 
tomatoes,  green  chillies,  coriander,  haldi,  red  chilly 
powder and salt. Mix well, crushing together slightly with 
the  fingers,  so  that  the  natural  juices  mix  well  together. 
Place this mixture on a low flame. Since there is no oil or 
water  in  this,  keep  stirring  and  mashing  with  a  spoon. 
The  onions  and  tomatoes  will  soften  and  release  a  little 
moisture.  At  this  stage  add  the  coconut  milk  and  keep 
stirring until the mixture comes to a boil. Add a pinch of 

sugar if so desired.

Immediately remove from the flame and serve hot.  This 
sheere goes well with the Khichadi or even with plain rice.

the  almonds,  cardamom  powder,  date  powder,  saffron 
paste  and  baking  powder.  Mix  well. Add  warmed  ghee 
reserving a little for smearing the baking dish. Allow to 
stand  for  15  minutes.  Spread  the  remaining  ghee  with 
your fingers over the base and sides of a square or round 
baking dish. A Borosil bowl will do. Dust the inside of the 
dish with flour. Pour the semolina mixture into the baking 
dish. The mixture should be of pouring consistency. If not, 
add a little more warmed milk.

outside the plate as is a glass of chaas (thin buttermilk). 
As you sit at the table and begin the meal, the rotlis are 
served  hot  and  all  items  replenished  as  you  want  them. 
The idea of spooning different items in katoris (or vadkis), 
I am told by Hasmukh Shah, former President, Heritage 
Trust, Baroda, probably goes back to the description of a 
meal as ‘8 vadki nu jaman’, ‘6 vadki nu jaman’ and ‘4 vadki 
nu jaman’ (a thali meal with 8 katoris would be a banquet 
meal). According to the importance of the guests invited 
to the meal, the presiding housewife would decide which 
‘jaman’ to prepare and serve!

The thali as a restaurant product first made its presence felt 
sometime in the 1970s. I remember eating my first thali at 
a restaurant called Sabras in Ahmedabad. The restaurant 
closed but the thali took off like a hot roti (amongst both 
Gujarati  and  non-Gujarati  families!)  and  continues  to 
reign  as  the  most  popular  regional  ‘sit-down-served-at-
the-table’ buffet. This spawned several me-too thalis in the 
process – the Punjabi thali, Rajasthani thali, Bengali thali, 
Periyar  thali,  and  so  on.  What  continues  to  puzzle  me, 

however, is why would Gujju families who generally have 
DBRS (Dal-Bhaat-Rotli-Shaak) almost every day for lunch, 
want to go out in a restaurant and eat the same thing? 

By  and  large,  Gujaratis  are  vegetarians,  though  there 
are also enough communities in the state who are meat-
eaters and have developed wonderful recipes with not just 
chicken, mutton and seafood but also game meat. There is 
an amazing Eedapak (Egg barfi!) that was demonstrated 
by an aging Parsi matriarch from Navsari on chef Aditya 
Bal’s ‘Lost Recipes’ TV show on the Epic channel. But the 
globe-trotting Gujarati veggie has almost single-handedly 
introduced world cuisine to the infinite possibilities and 
flavours of vegetarian food and cooking. Most airlines now 
offer the ‘Jain’ meal option, unheard of a decade ago, but 
equivalent to getting brownie points for vegetarianism. 

It is common knowledge that Gujaratis are enterprising, 
business-minded  people,  willing  to  take  risks  and  tread 
into  the  unknown.  Surat  and  Bharuch  on  the  southern 
coast of the state, Khambhat at the Gulf of Cambay have 
been  very  important  trading  posts  for  centuries,  with 

The Big, Fat Gujju Thali!

Sandhya Bordewekar Gajjar

Every  time  anyone  takes  a  bite  into  food  in  India,  the 
flavor  of  Gujarat  mingles  in  their  mouths.  That  flavor 
comes from salt, as almost 80% of Indian salt is harvested 
in this western-most state. It is no wonder that at dawn 
on the Hindu New Year’s day during Diwali, salt sellers 
rush about in every residential area throughout the state, 
yelling ‘Sabras lo!’ They give a handful of salt crystals in 
return of ‘baksheesh’ and the housewife switches on the 
Diwali lights and mixes the salt crystals in her kitchen’s 
salt jar. This ‘Sabras’, that adds taste to food, also promises 

good luck and year- round prosperity to the family.

In addition to salt, Gujarat has given one more culinary 
jewel  to  Indian  cuisine  –  the  thali.  The  Gujarati  thali 
offers  a  complete  meal,  in  terms  of  nutrition  as  well  as 
appeasement of the taste buds! It is a visual delight as well 
– a large metal plate with numerous colourful katoris filled 
with  at  least  three  different  vegetables,  kathol  (pulses), 
daal/kadhi, raita, and on the rest of the plate, a kachumbar 
(salad),  couple  of  pickles,  chutney  and  farsan,  papad,

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiabusiness links to merchants from Europe, East Africa, the 
Middle  East,  and  South-East Asia.  Gujaratis  travelled  to 
these countries in search of work and fortunes, took their 
culinary expertise with them but were also willing to be 
experimental  and  accepting  of  the  foods  and  flavours 
that  they  encountered  in  these  countries.  Just  last  year, 
in Rajkot, I found a tiny grocery store selling all the basic 
ingredients required for Sudanese cooking popular with 
the  Saurashtra  Gujaratis  who  had  lived  and  worked  in 
Sudan and for some reason have returned to the homeland 
but crave Sudanese delicacies. For the last few years, the 
Rander village on the outskirts of Surat has become very 
popular  for  the  Burmese  adapted  vegetarian  and  non-
vegetarian dishes that were prepared during the Ramzan 
month. Foodies drove down all the way from Mumbai and 
Ahmedabad to taste these dishes. A report in the Times of 
India  this  Ramzan  wrote  that  the  locals  are  planning  to 
have this popular ‘night eats’ market throughout the year 
and not limit it to Ramzan only! It is not for nothing that 
there is a saying in Gujarati –Surat nu jaman ane Kashi nu 
maran! (Surat to eat and Kashi to die!)

Since  the  late  1960s  and  especially  after  Idi  Amin’s 
expulsion of Asians from Uganda, Gujaratis began moving 
to the UK, USA and Canada as safer countries for work 
and often immigration. In the 1980s, Australia and New 
Zealand  were  added  to  these  destinations.  The  popular 
foods  of  these  regions  obviously  have  dominated  the 
young Gujarati’s palate in current times – pizzas, burgers, 
donuts,  footlongs,  hot  dogs,  and  with  them  a  range  of 
Tex-Mex stuff like tacos, enchiladas, and what-have-you. 
Even local Gujaratis, who may not have travelled much, 
are not averse to trying out new cuisines, even if it means 
smothering the plate with tomato ketchup if the taste does 
not go down well. Middle-eastern foods, that share a kind 
of spicy taste as Indian foods, are a rage, as are the ‘desi 
Chinese’ preparations that have nothing even remotely to 
do with China, except maybe the soy sauce.

Eating out – a concept generally frowned upon in Gujarati 
households  till  about  three  decades  back  –  is  now  de 
riguer. A Facebook page, Food Addicts in Ahmedabad and 
Foodies in Baroda is one of the most active with followers 
increasing  by  the  day.  Their  updates  share  information 
about new restaurants, evaluate the fare served on taste, 
quality, pricing and service, and most recently, with typical 
Gujju gusto, a debate has been initiated on cheating by most 
restaurants on calculation of taxes and service charges on 
the final bill! The page also provides excellent platform for 
those  who  want  to  publicize  their  food  ventures  –  tiffin 
services, pop-up kitchens, meal deals, and one of the most 
valuable, where to get food in the city between midnight 
and 4 am!

Gujarati  cuisine  is  elaborate,  wonderful,  and  multi-
dimensional though a tad on the sweet side. The Kathiawadi 
(Saurashtra) and Kachchhi cuisines are different in some 
ways from the mainstream Gujarati but each region has 
its own magical and mouth-watering range of savory and 
sweet delights. Let’s look at a few here …

Gujju  Fast  Foods:  The  most  popular  is  the  Kachchhi 
Dabeli with roots in the town of Mandvi. A local version 
of the Vada-Pav, the potato vada is jazzed up with fried 
groundnuts and a sprinkling of pomegranate seeds! Recent 
favourites are ‘live’ dhokla and piping hot ‘papdi no loat’ 
(rice flour cooked in hot water, ground green chillies and 
ajwain, served with a spoonful of cold oil). Certain places 
have also become popular for specific foods. For instance, 
Kanjari  village  in  Anand  district,  is  known  for  its  fried 
patras  in  the  colacosia  season!  The  regular  nasta  foods 
such as handvo, muthiya, khaman, khandvi, kachori, and 
thepla still rule the Gujarati kitchen. Fresh fafda and jalebi 
continue  to  be  the  hottest  breakfast  all  over  Saurashtra! 
The influence of Marathi fast food in Vadodara (as a result 
of the Gaekwadi influence) can be seen in the perennial 
popularity  of  sev-usal  for  years  and  in  recent  times,  the 

35

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiaresurgence  of  sabudana  vada  and  sabudana  khichadi 
served at roadside larries. 

Festive  Fare:  From  the  month  of  Shravana  to  the  Holi 
festival  in  Phaguna,  Gujaratis  are  almost  constantly 
celebrating  some  festival  or  another.  Vedmi  (puranpoli), 
laadoo  (fried  wheat  flour  patty  pounded,  mixed  with 
sugar/jaggery and rolled in poppy seeds), garam maghaz 
(with  besan  flour),  jalebi,  dudhpak,  shiro  are  the  old 
favourites while lapsi (made with broken wheat) is a must-
have on every happy occasion. Seasonal delicacies such as 
gulabpak and khajoorpak in Kachchh and adhadiya (from 
urad dal) in Saurashtra in the winter are traditional and 
popular, never mind the ghee-induced cholesterol issues.

Rural  Fare:  In  most  villages,  rotlas  made  from  bajra, 
maize  and  jowar  are  the  staple,  and  khichadi  with  milk 
or  buttermilk  is  served  for  dinner.  Breakfast  is  usually 
the  leftover  rotla  broken  into  pieces  or  the  khichadi 
mixed  with  buttermilk,  salt,  turmeric  and  green  chillies 
and  given  a  tadka  with  mustard  seeds  and  asafoetida. 
Totally yum! In urban homes, old-timers still do the same 
with leftover rotis. This was a favourite with late potter-
ceramist Kumud Patel and her sisters and I was privy to a 
mild quarrel that broke out in her home when one of the 
sisters polished off the ‘Vaghareli rotli’ without sharing it 
with the others! The famous Gujarati undhiya is actually a 
much simpler rural celebratory and communal feast with 
the winter harvest of new potatoes, brinjals, beans, sweet 
potatoes – all lightly spiced with salt, ajwain and oil, and 
put  separately  in  clay  matkas  whose  mouths  are  sealed 
with a local weed growing in the fields. Then the matkas 
are  upturned  (hence  the  name,  undhiya),  put  in  a  large 
hole in the ground, covered with hay and given a bhadko. 
The farmers know for how long to keep stoking the fire till 
the veggies in the matkas are cooked. The cooked veggies 
are served on leaf plates and each person has to peel his 
own  veggies,  then  mash  them,  pour  a  little  oil  and  mix 

36

in the fresh chilli chutney and the garlic chutney and eat 
it. A version of this undhiya, called ubadiya is popular in 
the winters in south Gujarat and makeshift stalls come up 
along the entire western highway from Vapi to Valsad in 
these 2-3 months. Personally, I find it way better than the 
undhiya!

Darbar Fare: Gujarat was made up of hundreds of large 
and small princely states. The erstwhile rulers are either 
Rajput  Hindus  or  Nawab  Muslims.  They  are  popularly 
known  as  Darbars  and  their  modest  palaces  are  known 
as Darbargadhs. They are usually non-vegetarian unless 
they have accepted the Swaminarayan way of life (as has 
happened  with  many  Darbars  in  Saurashtra).  Many  of 
them were avid shikaris before hunting game was banned 
so their scrumptious dishes made with venison, partridge, 
wild  boar,  hare,  grouse  are  now  adapted  to  mutton  or 
chicken. The Maharaja of Sailana, Digvijaya Singh’s classic 
book, Cooking Delights of the Maharajas, has recipes from 
the Maharaja of Bhavnagar (Mokal Bhavnagar), and from 
Mallik Saleem Khan Saheb of Dasada (Kofta Saleem), 

an  unholy  mix  of  chaats  and  chilli  paneer,  pasta  and 
pizza, noodles and naans, tawa fry and tindola rice, is the 
traditional Gujarati lagan nu jaman – with daal and ladoo, 
vaal  (these  have  completely  disappeared,  replaced  with 
indifferently made chole or rangooni vaal), flawar-bataka 
nu  shak,  puri  and  shrikhand.  This  is  a  really  sad  story, 
because this phenomenon is reaching villages too.

Wedding  Feasts:  The  worst  hit  cuisine  in  the  turmoil 
wrought  by  the  crazy  desire  to  serve  a  buffet  spread  of 

Parsi  Cuisine:  Among  the  most  adaptable  and  joyous 
‘immigrants’  to  Gujarat  are  the  quickly  depleting  Parsi 

community whose ancestors, fleeing religious persecution 
in  Persia,  landed  on  the  coast  of  Sanjan,  near  Navsari. 
Hearty eaters, the story of their acceptance is also food-
related.  The  king  of  Sanjan  sent  a  glass  of  milk  filled  to 
the brim with his minister to the leader of the Parsis. The 
elderly Parsi looked at the glass and understood what the 
king wanted to say. He took a spoonful of sugar and gently 
slipped  it  in  the  milk,  stirring  carefully  till  it  dissolved 
and sent it back. The king received it, tasted the milk and 
allowed the Parsis to land and live in his kingdom. The 

37

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaParsis  have  since  blended  into  the  Indian  sub-continent, 
sweetening the environment wherever they are, especially 
if  there  is  an  egg  around!  Broken  over  a  skillet  of  fried 
potato  or  bhindi  sabzi,  the  iconic  bhinda  par  eenda,  the 
delightful akoori (scrambled eggs, the secret being the eggs 
are broken into cold oil), and the very popular dhansaak 
(meat cooked with vegetables and a mix of different dals), 
are  Parsi  favourites  that  have  made  their  way  into  non-
Parsi Indian kitchens as well.

Frugal Foods: Like in all regions, there is a range of frugal 
foods that one looks forward to when not feeling too well, 
when  the  rich  and  spicy  fare  makes  you  nauseous,  or 
simply because it is what your mother fed you as a child. 
The most popular frugal food is the humble khichadi, made 
with rice mixed different dals and sometimes vegetables 
too. My friend, architect Nandita Amin, ardent foodie and 
avid globetrotter, says, “The day I come home from any 
of  my  travels,  I  need  to  have  a  meal  of  simple  khichadi 
and dudhi (the humble bottle-gourd) nu shaak!” But there 
are other kinds of frugal foods too in the state, especially 
in  rain-scanty  regions  such  as  Saurashtra  and  Kachchh 
where  fresh  vegetables  may  be  scarce  or  expensive.  For 

38

instance, my mother-in-law sundried cleaned watermelon 
peels  that  would  otherwise  be  thrown  away,  and  stored 
them for use in place of regular vegetables in the summer. 
Vegetables  that  were  very  cheap  in  the  season,  such  as 
cluster beans (gawar), or discarded parts of fruits, such as 
mango seeds (gotlas) were also dried in the hot summer 
sun and stored for future use.

Pickle Pots: Pickles are the mainstay of Indian kitchens. 
They  make  excellent  accompaniments  with  rotis/rotlas 
as  well  as  with  khichadi,  especially  in  the  absence  of 
vegetables,  in  times  of  shortages  induced  by  droughts, 
floods,  famines,  or  when  the  housewife  is  too  tired  to 
go  out  and  shop  for  foodstuffs.  Pickles  in  Gujarat  use 
various kinds of fruits and vegetables and can be sweet or 
savoury or sometimes a delicately balanced mix of both. 
Pickles are so popular and so widely prepared by almost 
every household that Gujarat even has a ceramic hub – at 
Thangadh – to make the cream and brown ceramic, glazed 
bottles to store the pickles in!

Sadya - The Kerala Feast for  

Body, Mind & Spirit

Chef Narayanankutty, Kalari Rasayana, Kollam

Sadya  is  a  vegetarian  Kerala  feast  of  varied  colours, 
textures, consistencies & tastes with parboiled rice as the 
staple.  The  number  of  dishes  in  a  Sadya  are  many  and 
can  go  up  to  65  or  more  depending  on  the  will  of  the 
host to satisfy his guests. It is always served on a banana 
leaf  as  per  the  traditional  gastronomic  rules  and  eaten 
by hand utilizing all the five fingers which are said to be 
the conduits of the five elements that constitute our body 

(Fire, Air, Ether, Earth & Water). Kerala’s Hindu tradition 
is predominantly vegetarian and their everyday meal also 
consists of rice with fewer vegetarian curries than a Sadya.

The current lavish form of Sadya was instituted by the 18th 
century  King  Marthandavarma  of  Travancore  dynasty 
who ordered healthy & princely meals for Brahmin priests 
reciting the Four Vedas (holy books) in 90 days (Murajapa) 

39

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiaas a penance for the lives lost while conquering the nearby 
smaller  Princely  States  to  form  the  larger  Travancore 
Kingdom. 

Kerala  had  an  agrarian  tradition  and  every  household 
was  self-sufficient  for  its  food  needs.  All  the  vegetables 
that went into a meal were picked from the garden in the 
homestead.  So,  the  meal  was  organic  and  had  seasonal 
and  regional  variations.  Because  there  are  so  many 
elements in a Sadya, the pickles and crisps, that would last 
for a few days, were prepared a day or two in advance. 
Other  preparations  began  at  the  crack  of  dawn,  so  that 
everything would be ready by lunch time. Sadya feast is 
only for lunch and dinner is always a lighter meal. 

What goes into a Sadya?
The course in a Sadya are pretty standard. It has:-
1.  Ozhikkan (to pour, mix and eat) 
2.  Koottan (to mix and eat) 
3.  Nakkan (to lick) 
4.  Maduram (sweet)
5.  Kadikkan (to bite)
6.  Staple rice and a palate cleanser called olan in between

It  starts  and  ends  with  dishes  that  calm  the  stomach, 
beginning with a daal (lentil) & ghee, served with hot rice 
and ending with buttermilk to aid digestion. Salt, pickles, 
upperi  or  crisps,  pappadom,  plantain  and  the  various 
curries except the pouring curries are laid out on the leaf 
prior to the arrival of the guest and at room temperature. 
Rice and curries meant for pouring consistency are served 
hot when the guest sits down to eat. The pickles (mango, 
lime, ginger curry and kichdi) and crispies are placed on 
the  left.  Then,  the  other  dishes  meant  to  be  mixed  with 
rice (Kuttan) and eaten, like avial (a mixed vegetable) and 
other curries are served in a line along the top half of the 
leaf.  The  rice  is  served  on  the  lower  half  with  pouring 

40

curries,  which  are  daal  &  ghee,  followed  by  sambar  (a 
lentil-based,  mixed  vegetable  curry).  Payasam  makes  an 
entry at the last. The meal is rounded off with a little rice 
and buttermilk /rasam to settle the stomach.

Etiquette	of	eating	on	a	banana	leaf	(ela)
Traditional etiquette of eating on a banana leaf, have slight 
regional differences. Largely, the narrow part of the leaf 
faces the left, there by the cut side to the right. Sometimes, 
people  will  lightly  wet  the  leaf  as  they  sit  down  for  the 
meal and give it a wipe with their hand. After the meal, 
the leaf is folded down the middle way from the person. In 
the olden days, guests used to sit on the floor with crossed 
legs with the leaf also on the floor or short stools and short 
tables with leaf on the short tables, but today people find 
it inconvenient and the Sadya is served at the table. Sitting 
on  the  floor  and  eating  helps  in  better  digestion  due  to 
an  additional  blood  circulation  at  the  digestive  tract. 
Traditionally,  the  elder  in  the  house,  called  a  karnavar, 
would  point  out  to  whoever  was  serving,  that  a  person 
needed a second helping of a curry or rice.

Healthy and local
Whether it is the feast Sadya or a normal meal it is the vedic 
wisdom  handed  over  from  generations.  It  encompasses 
food as nature in its purest form, slow cooked (Mannagni) 
and  eaten  slowly  with  reverence  (mindful  eating).  The 
Sadya  might  seem  like  an  overly  heavy  meal,  but  it  is 
prepared with local, fresh, seasonal and whole ingredients 
and  is  suited  to  the  environment.  It  is  a  balanced  meal 
that packs in the six tastes prescribed in Ayurveda - sweet, 
sour, salty, bitter, pungent and astringent. Since the Sadya 
incorporates all the tastes, it satiates one’s palate and one 
does not tend to overeat. 

Although Sadya is based on the Hindu traditions it is now 
a tradition by people of all class and creed, depicting the 
secular character of the Kerala State!

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiamuch difficulty. Traditional Saraswat cooking is not very 
spicy  and  is  therefore  nutritious  and  good  for  health.  I 
have  laid  special  stress  on  such  recipes  and  methods  of 
cooking”.

The  next  Saraswat  Cook  book  called  “The  Konkani 
Saraswat  Cook  Book”  was  published  with  a  second 
edition coming out in 2014. I have enclosed photographs 
of both the cook book covers. I am also quoting from the 
author’s note written by Asha S. Philar. “As we took the 
book forward, we discovered that Konkani Saraswat food 
has  a  ‘whole-earth’  approach  with  its  use  of  vegetables, 
roots, shoots, leaves, pulses and grain. Peels, pith, flowers 
and seeds have their place, as do traditional practices of 
storing  food  past  the  season.  They  represent  simplicity, 
thrift, intentions to conserve limited resources, all of these 
with  an  eye  to  nutrition.  The  cuisine  also  has  charming 
departures from the expected, for example a kheeri which 
is ‘cheppi’ (non-sweet) and a salad of broken pappads.”

Saraswat Cuisine

Tara. N. Chandarvarkar

Khotte

The Chitrapur Saraswat Community is a small community 
of about 25,000 with its own distinct style of cooking. It 
is not very spicy with the exception of a few dishes. The 
first attempt to make it into a cook book was made by the 
late Ambabai Samsi as early as the mid 1930’s. She had it 
completed in manuscript form along with an author’s note. 
Unfortunately  she  passed  away  very  suddenly  in  1938. 
So  it  was  left  to  her  daughter-in-law  the  late  Kalyanibai 
Samsi, who with the help of a few other ladies published 

the  first  edition  in  Marathi  in  1943  under  the  name  of 
“Rasachandrika”, followed by an English edition in 1988. 
In  her  author’s  note Ambabai  Samsi  says:  “Since  formal 
academic  education  has  now  become  more  widespread 
than in my time, girls cannot devote much time to cooking 
till they are about 20. As a result it becomes very difficult 
when  they  first  undertake  the  responsibility  of  cooking. 
Under these circumstances Saraswat girls can refer to this 
book and start cooking typically Saraswat dishes without

8.	 Sweet	Phenori	Pastry	(Gode	Phenori)

• 
• 
• 
• 

• 

• 
• 
• 

 3 cups maida (refined flour)
 A pinch of salt
 1 cup milk or water for mixing
 3 cups sugar -Prepare a thick syrup of one-thread 
consistency 
 1.1/2 cups water -About 220 degrees F / 105 degrees 
C
 1 tsp cardamom powder
 4 table spoons ghee
 Oil for deep frying

Method
Add  salt  and  milk  or  water  to  the  maida  (flour),  rub  in 
half the ghee into the flour mix and make a stiff dough. 
Divide the dough into equal sized portions (about 20 – 27). 
Roll each portion into thin rotis. Heat the rest of the ghee. 
Place the puri on a cutting board and smear it with a little 
ghee. Sprinkle a little riceflour or cornflour over the ghee. 
Place a 2nd puri on the 1st one a little further away from 
the edge (‘in staircase’ formation). Repeat the process of 

smearing the ghee and riceflour on each roti placed. When 
you have stacked 7 puris in this ‘staircase’ formation, fold 
in the sides and fold into a roll. Cut the roll into thin discs 
about a sixth of an inch thick. Lightly roll out each slice 
into a thick puri without pressing it too hard. When all the 
puris for the phenori are ready, deep fry them in hot oil 
on medium heat. Turn them over once or twice. When the 
fried phenoris are ready, dip them (about 4 or 5 at a time) 
in  the  warm  sugar  syrup  flavoured  with  the  cardamom 
powder. Coat them uniformly with the sugar syrup and

The Allure of Rich Punjabi Cuisine

Davinder Kumar

Punjab is a combination word, in Persian, Punjab means 
Punj (Five) and Ab (Water). It is the “Land of the Five” 
–  the  Beas,  Satluj,  Chenab,  Ravi  and  Jhelum  rivers  and 
is  also  India’s  granary-  producing  more  than  half  of  the 
wheat, rice and millet grown in the country. The fertility of 
its fields and the richness of its dairy produce are the envy 
of the subcontinent. The earliest references to the region’s 
food  were  made  in  the  ancient  Hindu  Vedic  scriptures 
more than 3,000 years ago.

Punjab  has  experienced  diverse  culinary  influences. 
Its  proximity  to  Persia,  Afghanistan  and  Central  Asia 
cultivated a taste for fresh and dried fruits and exotic nuts. 

The  rich  streams  of  Hindus,  Sikhs  and  nomadic  Pathan 
tribes have, over the millennia, enriched the cuisine and 
Punjabi  people  have  lovingly  cherished  and  preserved 
their far-reaching tastes and eclectic cooking traditions. 

The  Partition  of  India  in  1947  brought  unprecedented 
numbers of Punjabi refugees to the rest of the country, who 
carried with them the rich diversity of their food. A string 
of Punjabi roadside restaurants called dhabas sprang up all 
over the larger cities and mushroomed on every highway. 
Dhabas started not as a business proposition, but as the 
refugees’ basic need for survival.

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaThe  remains  of  an  ancient  tandoor  oven  have  been 
discovered  in  an  excavation  at  the  Indus  Valley.  Today, 
the  oven’s  widespread  popularity  should  be  credited 
to  the  intrepid  and  extremely  mobile  Punjabi  people. 
The  cuisine  in  Punjab  is  exceptionally  responsive  to  the 
changing seasons. Winter is welcomed with Makke ki roti 
and Sarson da Saag.

In  1947,  the  greater  Punjab  (British  Punjab  of  1903)  was 
divided  into  two  Punjab:  Pakistani  Punjab  and  Indian 
Punjab.  The  North  West  Frontier  Province  was  also 
influenced  with  Bukhara  style  cooking.  Baluchistan  and 
the Province of Sindh also influence Punjabi cooking due 
to their close proximity.

The cuisine of Punjab has an enormous variety of mouth-
watering  vegetarian  as  well  as  non-vegetarian  dishes. 
The  spice  content  ranges  from  minimal  to  pleasant  to 
high.  Punjabi  food  is  usually  relished  by  people  of  all 
communities and home cooking differs from the restaurant 
style cooking. In restaurants, the chefs make a liberal use of 
desi ghee, butter and cream to make the food delicious and 
finger licking. On the other hand, at home, people prefer 
using sunflower oil or some other refined oil for cooking, 
with the basic idea of making the food low in fat content, 
with minimal usage of butter and cream.

Wheat flour is the staple food of Punjabis; however, they do 
enjoy eating rice on festivities and other special occasions. 
When  it  comes  to  food,  each  region  in  Punjab  has  an 
entirely different preference - like people in Amritsar are 
particularly fond of stuffed paranthas and milk products. 
The philosophy of life for most of the Punjabis is to eat, 
drink and be merry. While preparing Punjabi food onion, 
ginger  and  garlic  are  used  extensively  to  enhance  the 
flavours. 

Traditional Punjabi thali consists of varied kinds of breads; 
some are baked in the tandoor such as tandoori roti, laccha 
paratha, naan and kulcha, while others are dry baked on 
the  tava  (pan)  like  chapatti  and  jowar  ki  roti.  There  is 
another fabulous variety of roti called rumali roti, which is 
thinner and larger in size as compared to the normal one 
and is also easily absorbable. There are also breads that are 
shallow fried such as parantha and deep-fried such as puri 
and bhatoora.

Popular Dishes
The  food  items  that  form  a  part  of  the  traditional  foods 
of  Punjab  are  so  eye-catchy  and  tempting  that  you  can 
hardly resist them. Some of the popular delicacies of the 
State are - Sarson ka Saag, Makki ki Roti, Dal Amritsari, 

Choley, Shahi Paneer, Tandoori Chicken, Butter Chicken, 
Rarha Meat, Amritsari Machli, Kadhi and more.

but an exuberant use of masalas, with a touch of pure ghee 
is what works best.

The  local  cuisine  of  Punjab  is  heavily  influenced  by  the 
agriculture and farming lifestyle that has been prevalent 
for  centuries.  The  people  in  this  State  generally  go  for 
spicy  food  and  use  oil  and  ghee  to  considerably  higher 
levels. There are no intricate marinades or exotic sauces, 

Punjab  is  a  major  producer  of  wheat,  rice  and  dairy 
products, which form the staple diet of Punjabi people and 
the people of Punjab prefer wheat to rice. In roti itself, you 
find such a wide variety that you are left to wonder how 
versatile the cuisine is?

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaHyderabadi Cuisine

Salma Hussain

It is believed that one of the ways to judge the greatness 
of a culture is to look closely at its cuisine. Old Hyderabad 
was  famous  for  its  hospitality,  generosity  and  cuisine. 
Wedding  feasts,  celebrations  and  parties  were  common 
place and were occasions for people to demonstrate their 
hospitality.  Hyderabadi  cuisine  today  is  known  all  over 
the world for its special nature and its infinite variety. It 
has few peers in the sub-continent for sheer range as well 
as delicacy of taste. Let me list out some of the well-known 
culinary dishes of Hyderabadi food.

Tutak-Luqmi  –  (among  many  kinds  of  starters),  Pasinda 
Khabab, Sheekh Kabab – Chaal ke kabab – Nargisi Kofta 
–  Shikampur  and  Shaami  Kababs,  Biryani  Khaam  and 
Biryani  Zard/Zafani  combined  with  Dum  ke  Baingan  / 
Baghaare  Baingan,  Mirch  Ka  Saalan,  Kulti  ka  cut.  Joban 
Malti or Maati was another exquisite culinary preparation 
cooked  on  special  occasions.  Several  varieties  of  breads 
including Baqar khani roti, Mullah dupyaza ki roti, Bibi 
marium ki roti, Sheermal, Kulcha or Kulecha / Naan. Dam 
Ka Murgh. Different varieties of Qorma, Sada Qorma, Allu 
Ka  Qorma,  Kada  Qorma  and  Jahazi  Qorma  –  different 
kinds  of  daalchas,  do  Pyaazas  and  Qalias.  Worthy  of 
special  mention  is  Sarkari  Dalcha  consisting  of  different 
lentils and Maahi Qalia.

Among  deserts  many  Hyderabadi  preparations  are 
popular the world over today. A few typically Hyderabadi 
desserts,  deserve  to  be  mentioned.  Double  ka  meetha, 
seviyon  ka  muzafir,  maaquti,  sheerberanj  and  dum  ki 
puranpuri are just a handful of names from hundreds of 
rich  varieties  which  adorned  the  “Dastarkhaan”  of  old 
Hyderabad.

The  wealthy  and  leisured  aristocracy  of  the  erstwhile 
Nizam  State  as  well  as  the  long  peaceful  years  of  their 
dominance, contributed largely to the development of the 
Hyderabadi  Cuisine.  Their  devotion  to  the  culinary  art 
made it a princely legacy of the Nizam’s of Hyderabad.

Hyderabadi  cuisine  is  an  amalgamation  of  Mughlai, 
Turkish and Arabic cuisine with a healthy native influence. 
The  variety  of  ingredients  commonly  used  comprises 
mainly of rice, wheat, vegetables and meat. Mutton as well 
as chicken is used for special occasions. Skilled usage of 
various natural edibles, such as almonds, apricots, walnuts, 
cashew, coconut, peanut, sesame, poppy seeds and many 
spices like cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, caraway seeds, 
red  chilies,  turmeric,  cumin  seeds,  fenugreek,  pepper, 
coriander,  nutmeg,  bay  leaves,  fennel,  etc.  and  many 
beneficial herbs and flavors make this cuisine identical. It 
is slightly sour in taste, tomatoes and tamarind is used for 
the purpose.

A unique procedure of “Dum” is used; it is sealing the dish 
with dough and gently simmering its ingredients over slow 
fire to increase the absorption of the aromatic spices. Dum 
and barbecue are the techniques used for the preparation 
of mutton and chicken and the food is flavoured by the 
smoking process.

Mealtime  in  a  Hyderabadi  home  was  not  just  a  routine 
but  also  a  ritual,  a  time  for  celebration. A  meal  was  the 
grand finale and no guest could leave a Hyderabadi home 
without sharing a meal with the family.

Modern Hyderabadi cuisine evolved during the period of 
Nizam’s and elevated to a sublime art form. It is the result of 

many innovative technique and many new combinations 
tried  and  led  by  the  mastered  chef’s  (khansamas)  of 
the  royal  kitchen.  Most  of  the  modern  day  dishes  in 
Hyderabadi cuisine were introduced and invented during 
the times of Nizam’s and had become an integral part of 
the Hyderabadi food.

Shahi  Dastarkhan  was  the  dining  place  where  food  was 
served and eaten. “Chowki” - a low table was used instead 
of the dining table and cotton mattresses for squatting and 
bolsters for the backrest were used.

The  herbs  and  spices  used  in  the  dish  as  well  as  the 
method of preparation often give the dish its name. For 
formal  occasions  Hyderabadi  food  is  garnished  with 
“warq”, a very fine pure silver leaf created by prolonged 
hammering  and  flattening.  Some  of  the  dishes,  which 
make Hyderabadi cuisine distinct, are:

Dum  Biryani:  The  most  famous  meat  and  rice  dish, 
a  traditional  celebration  and  stairway  to  heaven.  An 
authentic Hyderabadi meal invariably includes biryani of 
mutton or chicken. Meat is stir fried with spices, marinated 
with curd and other spices for couple of hours and cooked 

with  basmati  rice  (the  best  quality  of  rice)  using  the 
procedure of “dum” (slow oven). Soaked saffron is used 
for its aroma and biryani is a must for feasts and festivals.

Mirch  ka  Salan:  It  is  served  along  with 
the Hyderabadi biryani. Coconut, peanut, 
sesame seeds along with some spices are 
used for the unique refreshing flavour.

Hyderabadi Haleem: It is a dish made with wheat, meat 
and pure ghee. Cooked for 
hours  to  get  the  porridge 
like  paste, 
it  has  high 
nutritive  value  because  of 
its contents, usually served 
to break the fast in Ramzan.

Hyderabadi  Marag:  A 
spicy meat soup, it is light 
in  texture  and  prepared 
with tender mutton. It is a 
perfect starter.

Hyderbadi Nahari Paya: It is prepared with sheep or goat 
trotters. Paste of nuts and spices are used, then garnished 
with rich cream and served hot with “naan” or “sheermaal” 
(soft special bread).

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiawomen  and  thus,  an  indigenous  Muslim  community 
consisting of those with Arab blood took root in Kerala. 
They were called Mapillah meaning Maha Pillai, meaning 
someone  held  in  high  esteem.  Mapillah  also  means 
bridegroom. The local converts too were identified by this 
name  and  today  roughly  20%  of  the  Kerala  population 
comprises of Muslims. 

Malabar cuisine is the synthesis of two culinary traditions. 
As in the case  of newborn where relatives of parents lay 
claim to this or the family likeness, it is tempting to carry 
out  a  culinary  DNA  matching  with  the  recipes  as  the 
genetic code. For E.g. the abundant use of coconut is clearly 
Malayali trait, but ghee (clarified butter) inveigles its way 
into Mapillah kitchen. The Arabs used it and they called it 
Samn. The sheep’s head curry and the whole stuffed sheep 
served at Mapillah weddings is also an Arab legacy. The 
belief that the food must surprise the eater is the raison d’ 
etre for many stuffed dishes in the Middle East. In one of 
the Mapillah recipes a hardboiled egg is stuffed in whole 
chicken, which is encased in a pillow of dough. The Love 
of layering – think of Turkish BAKLAVA and the Yemini 
BINT al SAHN is mirrored in the Mapillah desert called 
Chattipathiri.  So  when  you  look  at  the  Malabar  recipes 
there  are  overlaps  of  cultures  and  kitchen  beyond  the 
shores.

The  way  we  eat  reflects  the  way  we  live  and  Mapillah 
cuisine  embodies  this.  It  owes  its  uniqueness  to  certain 
foods  and  certain  attitudes  towards  food.  Fasting  and 
feasting are taken seriously. Ramadan, the 9th month of 
Lunar Calendar is dedicated to fasting and prayers. This is 
the time when Mapillah women turn their hands to snack 
making in a big way. Alisa – a wheat potage a common 
dish also eaten in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon is a Ramadan 
special dish. 

Dinner is meant to fortify the eater for the next day’s fasting. 
This is where the Pathiri rules. Pathiri is a unique Mapillah 
creation. For e.g. the Podi PathiriI the simplest one is made 
from rice flour and resembles the North Indian Chappati. 
It is a very thin griddle roasted circular bread. But Pathiri 
as a genre displays complexity and diversely not seen in 
the other breads. Besides rice flour, Pathiri can be made 
from rice batter, deep fried like poori, steamed, eaten with 
curry and can be a standalone dish also. All in all there are 
at least 500 different types of Pathiris.

Though  life  in  Malabar  is  changing,  the  matrilineal 
tradition  endures  especially  in  North  Malabar.  After 
marraige the women continues to live in her family house 
or tharavadu with her husband and children. Assured of 
a roof and financial security she did not have to go out to 

Mapillah Cuisine

Faiza Moosa

Kerala the Coastal State, 39863 sq km lying in the extreme 
South of India is a tropical paradise with the green of rice 
paddies,  banana  plantations,  coconut  palms,  the  blue  of 
rivers and teeming seas. It presents an astonishing array of 
foods; white rice and coconut are de rigueur in the Malayali 
menu. There are so many unusual ways of preparing them 
that your palate is constantly pleasured.

Here in Kerala we have three main cuisines. The Muslim, 

Christian  and  the  Hindu  Cuisine.  The  North  of  Kerala 
about 580km coastline is called by the name Malabar and 
the Muslims here are referred to as Mopillas or Mapillahs 
and the cuisine is called “Mapillah Cuisine”.

It is said, that within a generation of the prophet’s death 
Islam had reached Malabar. Arab Merchants from Aden, 
Yemen and Oman were the early conduits through which 
the faith reached Malabar. They made alliance with local 

54

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiawork for a living. This gave her the leisure to master the 
culinary skills. Cooking was a woman’s art. Recipes were 
heirlooms passed from mother to daughter through listen 
–watch and learn method. The Tharavadu kitchens were 
big and all the laborious task like grinding, grating and 
pounding were hired. 

In  Malabar  marriages  are  mostly  “arranged  marriages”. 
The  feasting  begins  several  days  before  marriage  and 
during this time the traditional cuisine is showcased in all 
its glory. The appetizers are numerous and elaborate. At 
certain times the bread make their entry in a procession of 
pathiris, flaky wheat porottas etc. along with a flotilla of 
meat and chicken dishes. 

Then  follows  the  Biryani  accompanied  by  date  pickle, 
coconut chutney and raita ( a yogurt based relish). Certain 
dishes are only connected with weddings. For e.g. Alisa-
the  wheat  potage  and  the  mutta  maala  (the  egg  yolk 

sweet).  Wherever  there  is  a  Muslim  community  there  is 
Biryani.  Besides  Mutton  and  Chicken  Biryani’s,  Malabar 
also has unusual seafood Biriyani like the Fish Biryani, the 
Prawn Biryani etc. Arab Cuisine too has seafood and rice 
combos. Given the fact that it was not Mughals, but the 
monsoon winds that introduced the faith to Malabar, one 
wonder if the Malabar Biryani was not a product of the 
same process of synthesis – foreign cooking styles married 
to local ingredients – that created the local cuisine.

Everyday Mapillah food is not rich, nor has been, subjected 
to much experimentation. In the cooking of fish, coconut 
oil is used. A specialty of Malabar is Kallummakkai (the 
green lipped mussel that is found along the coast) is eaten 
stuffed, curried or fried.

As everywhere, in Kerala religion and history serve at the 
tabletop too, but its character comes from the extraordinary 
generosity of the Mapillah spirit.

PHULKOPI KORAISHUTIR TORKARI

Bhojohori Manna
The saga of rural cuisine

Siddhartha Chatterjee

The story of Bengali food has an age-old history. As Bengal 
and Assam are in the Gangetic belt, rice cultivation was 
predominant  and  that  made  the  locals  consume  mainly 
rice (called Bhat or boiled rice). Abundance of water bodies 
& rivers caused ample supply of various fish-both big and 
small for the locals to consume. Thus Bengal and Bangalis 
were branded as consumers of fish curries and rice. To a 
large extent Kerala also shared the same phenomenon and 
in  both  places  fish  eating  culture  continues.  You  cannot 
stop a “bangali” from talking about fish every day. 

Later, the British influence brought in various forms of fish 
eating  habits  like  fried  fish,  prawn  cutlet,  fish  coverage 

(called kabiraji) mainly using river Bekti and tiger prawns. 
Thus, these two types of fish got international acceptance, 
which still continues to be a delight for foodies across the 
world.  The  Japanese  consumes  a  major  portion  of  tiger 
prawns  of  the  Sundarbans.  The  commoners  continued 
consuming  cheaper  river  &  pond  fish  and  made  local 
curries  (akin  to  fish  soup),  which  is  still  the  staple  diet. 
With  the  advent  of  scientific  methods  of  farming  fish, 
Andhra  Pradesh  &  Gujarat  became  large  producers  of 
Rohu and Katla fish, which they distributed all over the 
country bringing in a sea change in fish eating culture.

Till about fifteen years back Bengal and its capital Kolkata 

56

57

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiahardly had any good eating places serving Bengali cuisine. 
There  were  very  few  Bangladeshi  restaurants  on  Free 
School  street  thronged  by  the  Bangladeshi’s.  On  an  up 
market scale, Aheli (Peerless group) and Qeupies served 
Bengali cuisine and there were roadside joints also called 
“Bhater  Hotel”  but  they  lacked  quality  and  ambience. 
This is when Bhojohori Manna was created without much 
fan fare. It was the brainchild of five friends who had a 
common passion for food but with no experience in food 
business. Initially it was decided that few snacky items will 
be on the menu but that could not generate sales required 
to sustain any kind of business. Hence some rice, fish & 
vegetable  curries,  daal  and  of  course  chicken  &  mutton 
curries  were  introduced.  Cooking  was  done  exactly  the 
way  it  was  done  in  any  household.  People  passing  by 
tried  the  food  and  they  liked  it  possibly  because  it  was 
simple. The word spread around and the regular shoppers 
around South Kolkata shopping area dropped by in the 
afternoon and enjoyed the food. The little place (18 seaters) 
on Ekdalia road (South Kolkata) where Bhojohori Manna 
started, soon got clumsy with paucity of space leading to 
long  ques.  Consumer  demand  led  to  a  slow  conversion 
of  simple  home  style  cooking  into  a  slightly  more,  if  I 
am  permitted  to  say  “  masaledar  cooking”.  Demand 

matrix led to creation of other outlets in Kolkata to cater 
to  consumers  closer  to  their  area  of  convenience.  Today 
we have presence in almost all parts of Kolkata as well as 
North  Bengal  (Siliguri)  Puri  (Odisha),  Bengaluru  and  of 
course Mumbai.

The  cuisine  started  with  some  local  cooks  who  went 
through a trial run before the first restaurant was opened. 
They  did  not  have  the  knowledge,  which  normally  a 
trained  chef  would  have  but  were  great  with  cooking”. 
They  are  still  with  us  and  hence  Bhojohori  Manna  runs 
till today without chefs or as a matter of fact any trained 
persons  from  the  hotel  management  schools.  They  are 
sourced from villages and do not have formal degrees but 
are great in their “rustic wisdom”. In some way we have 
been indulging in CSR activities right from the first day 
and also created small time entrepreneurs (mostly village 
women)  who  are  supplying  us  semi-cooked  food.  From 
very  poor  conditions,  these  families  now  have  a  decent 
living.

For our readers, let me present a few Bengali dishes, which 
could  give  you  an  insight  into  good  dining  experience. 
Fish comes naturally at the top of the list.

58

ILISH BHAJA

Kolkata Bekti (pronounced by locals as Bhetki) comes in 
the form of a whole fish -weighing about 2-3 kg. The fish 
has one central bone, which if taken out creates a boneless 
fillet.  Depending  on  what  you  want  to  make  out  of  it, 
these fillets are cut to different sizes to suit different kind 
of preparations. Most popular would be crumb fried fish 
(Bhetki Rongpuri as named by us) which goes very well as 
a starter. The word “Rongpuri” has been coined because 
of the usage of “ajwain” during the course of marination 
along with onion & ginger paste. This use, we believe is an 

adaptation of culinary skills from “Rongpur”(presently in 
Bangladesh). This with a dash of “Kasundi” (the Bengali 
version of mustard sauce) is absolutely a delight for food 
lovers.

The same betki in another form of a starter called “Bhetki 
Paturi”  is  a  wonder  creation.  This  is  a  steamed  betki  in 
cube  form,  marinated  with  mustard  paste  and  wrapped 
in banana leaves and then charcoal baked. Paturi is akin 
to  “patrani  machhee”(a  Parsi  will  explain  you  in  more 

59

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiadetails). The paturi can also be made with shrimps (chingri 
paturi) or hilsa (ilish paturi).

Bhojohori officially has 55 items in their menu only with 
fish. Each one has its origin from rural Bengal adapted to 
suit  modern  taste  bud  but  keeping  original  recipes  and 
spices intact.

Another very interesting fish item is called “Muitha”, an 
adaption from the delicacies of Dhaka (Bangladesh). It is 
again boneless “fish cakes” prepared from giant sized fish 
called “Chitol”, best available in river Brahmaputra. One 
side of the fish, which has soft bones, is scraped out to take 
the meat out. The small bones are separated out and the 
meat is mixed with boiled potato, which acts as a binder. 

The  dough  created  is  then  made  into  chops  and  boiled, 
cooled and then cut into diamond shaped pieces, which is 
later lightly fried in oil. The curry is separately made using 
onion, ginger & garlic paste, turmeric powder etc. Once 
it is cooked, the cakes are put into the curry and served 
hot. It is one of the finest delicacies. A Bengali son- in -law 
would be offered “Muitha” whenever he is visiting his in-
laws, as it is a delicacy.

The most sought after fish are Tiger Prawns, Hilsa (queen 
of  fish)  and  Kolkata  can  boast  about  the  best  quality  of 
these in India.

For  the  vegetarians,  it  will  be  interesting  to  note  that 
around  45  varieties  of  vegetable  dishes  are  on  the 
menu almost every day at the Bhojohori Manna outlets. 
Interestingly,  there  is  a  huge  use  of  banana  items  in 
Bengali dishes. Almost all parts of a banana tree are eaten 
by Bengali’s. The flower, stem and raw banana itself also 
finds way into Mocha Paturi, Shukto, Kach kolar kofta etc. 
and can be simply delicious when eaten with steamed rice. 

60

Needless to mention, these delicacies are rich in iron and 
vitamin. Bengali’s use of “Posto”(poppy seeds) in various 
vegetarian  dishes  is  well  known.  This  particular  food  is 
adapted  from  the  district  of  Purulia,  which  is  situated 
in Western Bengal and is considered a dry place. Use of 
poppy seeds leads to drowsiness and incidentally, this is a 
banned food item in UAE.

Daal (pulses) is also very popular with a Bengali and in 
almost all cases the lunch or dinner starts with mixing daal 
and rice. Unlike the North Indian variety, Bengali daal is 
not thick and is similar to lentil soup. Moong, masoor and 
chana daals are the favourites. There is an extensive use 
of coriander leaves and in some cases coconut. Daal is a 
must in Bengali cuisine. For a detailed menu, log –www.

Large Corporations & MNCs over the years have tried to 
introduce  products  created  by  them  through  extensive 
research & development into the rural parts of India and 
have  been  successful  in  creating  a  mass  market.  Thus 
rural India is now used to biscuits & beverages of western 
origin. Bhojohori Manna on the other hand has adapted 
rural food and presented the same in its original form to 
the urban consumers, which is gaining acceptance by the 
day. We are still working on adapting more of the village 
cuisine,  employing  more  rural  people  and  present  their 
skills to the urban population. Our journey to show case 
Indian food will now enter the international community 
through our humble entry in Dubai.

Bhojohori Manna is grateful to the publishers for allowing 
us an entry to narrate the saga of rural food transformation 
into the urban stream.

Bihari Cuisine

Deepak Gupta

A  question  that  is  often  asked,  “Is  there  a  separate 
Cuisine? You mean Bihari food is different – not just dal 
and rice. The next obvious question asked - What is it? The 
knowledgeable associate it with Litti and Choka, which of 
course is the most popular Bihari dish.

Unfortunately  this  land  of  intellectuals,  great  masters, 
flourishing empires and the seat of learning- the Nalanda 
University is famous today for crime and corruption. The 

true  Bihar  with  its  amazingly  rich  culture,  history  and 
food is completely submerged having lost any reference to 
its glorious identity.

In small pockets of Bihar there are still remnants of what 
constituted  the  seat  of  great  spiritual  and  intellectual 
power. To understand the food of Bihar, it is imperative 
to understand the history and culture, as the cuisine is an 
outcome of the influences that people have been through, 

61

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiafoods  include  ghee,  lassi,  butter,  yogurt  known  as  dahi 
and buttermilk known as mattha. The importance of milk 
products,  particularly  amongst  the  Maithils,  is  reflected 
through an old quotation:

“  Aadi  Ghee  aur  Ant  Dahi,  oyi  Bhojan  k  Bhojan 
kahi” (A good meal, is a meal that starts with ghee 
and ends with yogurt).

Breakfast in Bihar is a heavy meal comprising of paratha, 
poories  ,  sabjee/  vegetables,  channa,  dhuchka,  bhabhra, 
chhanch- a savoury crepe made from lentils & rice.

The Bihari thaali, even today changes every 3 to 4 months, 
gracing it with seasonal fresh vegetable dishes. There are, 
however,  some  constants  such  as  rice,  roti,  vegetables, 
achar, chatni, dals and milk products with some variation. 
The non-vegetarians would add a fish or lamb in addition. 
A  brilliant  concept  the  thali,  is  popular  as  it  offers  a 
wide range of flavors for the food loving, Bihari palette. 
The  dishes  mirror  condiments  like  jeera  or  panchforan 
(“five  seeds”,  namely  saunf,  sarson,  methi,  ajwain  and 
mangraeel / Kalaunji) are sprinkled generously across the 
dishes and for “chhounkna”--”Tadka”(tempering) of some 
vegetables. Cooking oils opted for would be vegetable oil, 
mustard oil and loads of ghee.

The  Turks,  Mughals  and  Romans  also  left  their  mark, 
bringing in the kebabs, biryani and kofte. The play of the 
meats, chicken and fish with a sprinkling of traditional & 
local Indian spices took the Indian non-vegetarian cuisine 
to  a  different  order  of  taste.  Some  of  these  famous  food 
items include Biharee Kabab, Shami Kabab, Nargisi Kofte, 
Shabdeg,  Yakhnee  Biryanee,  Mutton  Biryani,  Shalgum 
Gosht, Baqer Khani, Kulcha, Naan, Roti, Seveyee Zarda, 
Qemamee Seveyia, Gajar ka Halwa and Andeka Zafrani 
Halwa  among  many  others.  This  was  mentioned  by 
Maulana  Abul  Kalam  Azad  in  his  memoirs  where  the 
distinctive flavour of Bihari non-vegetarian cooking finds 
a special mention.

One  very  interesting  dish  in  Bihar  is  called  Dal 
Pithee.  This  is  our  Pasta  in  a  Lentil  broth!  Wheat 
pasta  florets  are  hand  made,  cooked  in  dal  & 
tempered with ghee & jeera. It is eaten with a spicy 
garlic, potato & brinjal preparation.

Biharis are quite famous for their Bihari kebabs, which has 
a very distinctive flavour and is fried unlike other kebabs, 
which are pan fried or roasted. This dish was traditionally 
made from mutton and is eaten with roti, paratha or boiled 
rice. 

One of the most remarkable results of the vegetables being 
cooked is the turn out of “smoked food”. It refers to using 
smoked red chilli to infuse a strong aroma in food. It is 
the same chilli that is used for successfully warding away 
evil spirits, these Chilli’s are available in a regular Bihari 
Kitchen.

The region of Champaran was ruled in ancient India by 
Sirdhwaj Janak, an erudite scholar as well as the temporal 
and  spiritual  lord  for  his  subjects.  Yagyavalkya  was 
his  chief  priest  who  codified  the  Hindu  law  known  as 
Yajnavalkya Smriti. Proximity to Bengal and Nepal lead to 
a tussle of years, with the Mughals taking over at one point 

not  only  of  the  last  decades,  but  impact  of  centuries.  It 
will be apt to set some context of global influence that has 
shaped the cuisine of this region. 

Bihar’s  antiquity  is  evident  from  its  name,  which  is 
derived  from  the  ancient  word  ‘Vihara’  (monastery), 
which evolved to Bihar due to the local penchant for all 
V’s being converted to Bh’s to match the basic dialect. It 
is one of the oldest inhabited places in the world with a 
history of 3000 years. It is a land that is blessed with the 
footprint  of  the  Masters  themselves  and  subsequently 
abounds with Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist, Jains, and Sikh 
shrines. This ancient land also bespeaks of the world’s first 
major empires rise and fall. 

The  cultural  mix  and  food  adventure,  with  Bihar  at  the 
central point expanded as Ashoka expanded his empire. 
The range of global impact was visible during the Mauryan 
Empire, when Ashoka, towered over nearly the entire sub-
continent and scholars like Megasthenes from Greece, Fa 
Hien and Hiuen Tsang from the east, traversed through 

the land and left their mark on the cuisine.

As  the  flow  of  the  Greeks,  Roman  Japanese,  Burmese, 
Cambodian,  Afghanis’,  Moghuls  and  British  flowed 
through Bihar, the cuisine and taste for alternative options 
evolved to a point that the pasta merged with dal in the same 
dish!  On  the  other  hand  some  pure  delicacies  remained 
as  the  royalty  and  generals  demanded  their  favourites. 
This lead to the local Bihari’s evolving their palette with 
no  less  than  crepes,  pasta,  dim  sums,  elaborate  kebabs, 
along with the bar-be-que or fried Litti’s. Yes, where there 
is prosperity the sweet tooth will be eclectic and the range 
of desserts evolved to be exotic and exciting. 

Lord  Buddha  attained  his  enlightenment  in  Bodhgaya, 
which  is  currently  the  ultimate  pilgrimage  point  for 
devotees and tourists. The impact of religion is significant 
of  the  region  and  the  Bihari  cuisine  is  predominantly 
vegetarian.  Vegetarian  diet  leans  over  to  compensate 
through  dairy  products,  which  are  a  part  and  parcel  of 
the  local  household,  throughout  the  year.  The  common 

62

63

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaThe Bihari meal whether vegetarian or non-vegetarian is 
trimmed with accessories. These can be crisps made out 
of lentils, poshto, sago, innumerable chutneys, papads – 
roasted/  fried  or  pickles.  What  makes  this  interesting  is 
the combinations that emerge – rice and dal with mango 
pickle and a handful of salted bhujia thrown in and mixed 
or some rice, coriander chutney and onions topped with 
ghee. 

Festivals and events like marriages are a big deal - Chhath 
Puja, Teej, Durga Puja, Kali Puja and Diwali. Chhath Pooja 
is one of the major festivals of Bihar, when devotees of Sun 
God fast. On the last day of the festival, the fast is broken 
by  consuming  the  Chhath  prasad.  Sweets  like  Kheer, 
Thekua [wheat cookies] & fruits are offered as prasad to 
the sun god by the river bank.

Thekua- a wheat home made cookie is quite easy to make:
500 gms whole-wheat flour
300 gms Gur (Jaggery)
4-5 green cardamom - peeled and mashed
Ghee (or Vegetable Oil)
1.5-cup of water

Make a mix of jaggery, water and green cardamom. Add 4 
tbsp ghee to the jaggery syrup prepared above and mix it 
to the flour and make a hard dough out of it.

Take a small piece of the dough, press it flat against your 
palm  and  then  press  it  on  a  cookie  mold  for  making 
thekua. Once the thekua has acquired the imprint of the 
mold, deep fry it in ghee till it gets reddish brown. Filter 
out the ghee and put them aside. Allow the thekuas to cool 
down and serve.

Bihar  offers  a  large  variety  of  sweet  delicacies,  which 
unlike  those  from  Bengal,  are  mostly  dry.  Worthy  of 

special  mention  are  Tilkut,  Khaja  from  Silao,  Peda  from 
Deogarh  and  Anarsa  from  Gaya  for  their  popularity. 
Another  interesting  desert  is  Khubi  Ka  Lai,  born  of  the 
Ganges every year when it floods. A special kind of weed 
covers  the  banks  and  the  seeds  are  extracted  from  this 
abundant weed. These are roasted, de-seeded and small 
fluffy tasteless minute popcorns come out of these black 
seeds.  These  are  then  mixed  with  Khoya  and  nuts  and 
made into white round balls called Khubi Ka Lai. 

The  Bihar  Cuisine  would  remain  incomplete  without 
a  reference  of  Paan  (betel  leaves).  Bihar  truly  thrives  on 
paan. It may have begun due to its antiseptic properties 
that freshen the breath and acts as a digestive. However, 
today  it  is  like  most  foods  taken  for  its  taste.  The  first 
reference of the paan is as early as two thousand years ago, 
in a book ‘Mahawamsa’ of Srilanka. The Vedas too refer to 
paan being the first offering to the guru ensuring its sacred 
and veneered status. 

This respectful status is further confirmed by an old Bihari 
saying Paan, Maach and Makhana (betel leaves, fish and 
lotus seed) is not even found in paradise, implying- enjoy 
what you have now on earth and not regret it later!

65

and then final fame came when Champaran became the 
integral part of the Indigo revolt known as the Champaran 
Satyagraha.  This  land  named  after  the  Magnolia  tree 
boasts today of a famous mutton dish called taash. Taash 
is a classic combination dish that is made by frying mutton 
but eaten with Chewra, The taash inside a parantha, gets 
promoted to be called a Bihari roll making it an odd but 
very appetizing dinner.

This Sub Himalayan tribal region in the North has a unique 
style & repertoire impacted by the tribal & the rivers. The 
Sone, Gandak and the Ganges, supplied an endless supply 
of  fishes  like  Rohu,  Katla  –  a  variety  of  carp,  Singhara, 
variety  of  cat  fish,  fresh  water  prawns,  crabs  and  small 
fishes.  As  eons  of  cultures  passed  by,  fish  recipes  were 
exchanged  and  changed  over  thousands  of  years,  with 
the fish curry cooked in mustard paste with rice (maaach-
bhaat) triumphing to this date. The villages and towns by 
the rivers lean towards fish with their preferred food being 
Macha Jhor famous in Mithila as well. While fried fish is 
popular, the Kekra Chokha prefers to be roasted and then 

mashed to prepare a crab (Kankor) dish. 

Bihari  food  would  not  be  complete  without  mentioning 
Pittha  a  special  food  of  the Anga  region.  This  is  Bihar’s 
answer to the dim sums of the East. I would guess that the 
Buddhist & the scholars of the East left some impact on 
this style of cooking. It is a unique dish prepared from rice 
flour stuffed with savory chana dal, It is then steamed / 
cooked in boiling water. Pittha can be made stuffed (sweet 
or salty) or unstuffed. It is then sautéed in ghee and jeera 
with salt & black pepper.

Litti  Choka  is  synonymous  to  Bihar  &  has  global 
recognition.  Sattu  is  mixed  with  onions,  garlic,  ajwain, 
kala jeera, and pickle. This is then stuffed in wheat dough, 
which  is  salted  and  flavored  with  ajwain  &  laced  with 
ghee. This is roasted on slow heat & served with potato or 
vegetable mash like hash-browns. This style of cooking & 
food is found in Rajasthan & even Australian Aboriginals 
have something similar.

64

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiawere called “Dhabas”. They served home style meals to 
the travellers. The menu was a simple Dal and a seasonal 
vegetable,  served  with  fresh  green  chillies  and  onions, 
accompanied with tandoori roti. The food was served on 
a  Manji  (string  cots)  with  a  wooden  plank  in  the  centre 
that served as a table, after a hearty meal the plank was 
removed and the weary traveller could sleep on the same 
cot. 

The Dhaba were responsible for spreading Punjabi cuisine 
throughout India. Today the daal makhni , palak paneer 
and tandoori roti are standard items on the menu in all 
restaurants  serving  Indian  food  anywhere  in  the  world. 
Some 5 star hotels have restaurants called ‘Dhaba” in their 
hotels. 

The  earliest  references  to  region’s  food  are  found  in  the 
Vedas, which documents the lives of the Aryans in Punjab. 
Amazingly the elements mentioned over 6,000 years ago 
are still extant in this cuisine. This includes dairy-i (milk), 
ghrit  (ghee),  dadhi  (curd),  shak  (leafy  green  vegetables) 
and  a  variety  of  lentils  and  grain.  Even  today,  these  are 
the staple in Punjab the unhusked mash is the mother of 
all lentils. Rajmah derives from the word raj mash or the 
regal mash. 

Punjab-this  side  of  the  border  or  that-is  situated  at  the 
crossroads  of  the  Silk  Route.  Caravans  of  goods  and 
food stuff have arrived in Punjab since Harappan times . 
Proximity with Persia, Afghanistan and China and Central 
Asia, has had a huge influence on the eating habits of the 
Punjabis. It gave them a taste for rice, fresh and dried fruits 
and  exotic  nuts.  It  is  said  that    Kabuli  or  large  Channa 
reached  Punjab  with  Alexander  the  Great’s  troops  who 
came to Punjab via Afghanistan. 

Amritsar,  which  was  the  commercial  capital  of  North 
India prior to partition, had traders from the entire Central 

Asia frequent its bazaars . As these traders did not have 
homes in Amritsar they were forced to eat out and several 
eateries opened in the city which specialised in catering to 
a variety of palates. Even today it retains its reputation as 
the gourmet capital of India.  

The most recent influence on Punjabi cuisine was that of 
the Mughals who brought with them the tradition of the 
great  tandoor  ,  ghost  (  mutton/  lamb  )  rice  pillao,  musk 
melons  ,  saffron,  anardana,  (dried  pomegranate  seed  ) 
khas, ( poppy seed ) , gulab sharbat and a host of other 
foods  and  flavours.  They  converted  the  simple  Punjabi 
fare to a sophisticated cuisine, considered one of the best in 
the world today. The British brought apples and potatoes 
and began their cultivation in hills of Kulu district.. The 
Punjabis continue to add foreign elements to their food. 
Button  mushrooms  being  the  latest  to  show  up  on  the 
menu, these were introduced to Punjab in the early 70s. 

Punjabis lay great emphasis on Dairy produce. Cow milk 
is  used  for  drinking  and  buffalo  milk  is  used  to  make 
dahi (yogurt), which when churned is made into chaach 
(buttermilk)  and  makhan  (white  butter),  which  when 
heated  is  made  into  ghee  (clarified  butter).  Milk  is  also 
split to make a cheese called paneer. When the whole milk 
is cooked slowly the top surface forms a thick skin which 
is harvested to be used as cream ( malai).

Punjabi food revolves around milk products, no meal is 
complete without their generous use. Warm cow milk is 
usually had at night before bed. Dahi and chaach are had 
daily at lunch. Dahi is often whipped into a raita by adding 
salt,  cucumber,  mint,  onions  or  any  other  combination. 
Dahi is also used to make creamy sauces such as Kormas 
and Kadi. Paneer is cooked in gravies and sauces and is a 
key part of the daily menu. Gobs of makhan are used to 
top breads ( roti ) or dals and saags to enhance the flavour. 
Ghee is used as primary cooking –fat or shortening. Malai

Where Food is Loved and Shared 

Punjabi Cuisine 

Geetika Kalha

“Punjabi Dhaba” or “Sher- e- Punjab” road side eateries 
can  be  seen  throughout  the  country.  This  is  the  most, 
recognised and trusted brand in India. It stands for good, 
fresh, hot, vegetarian food served with warmth and gusto. 
The  Dhaba  has  made  “Punjabi  food”  synonymous  with 
“Indian  food”.  Every  restaurant  in  the  country  serves 
Punjabi food. 

It all began with the partition of India in 1947. One of the 
most  lucrative  and  easily  available  occupations  for  the 
Punjabi refugees was that of a driver – of trucks and taxis. 
This  required  them  to  travel  throughout  the  country  on 
very  low  budgets.  Seeing  a  business  opportunity  other 
Punjabi  refugees  opened  roadside  eateries  to  carter  to 
the need for rest and food of these drivers. These eateries

The famous dal makhaani contains generous amounts of 
ghee, butter and cream. 

(Indian gooseberry), apples and ginger are also made into 
delicious  preserves.  .  Black  carrots  are  fermented  with 
water to make the very unique Punjabi drink called kanji. 

Wheat is Punjab’s staple grain, it is ground finely to make 
Atta or flour. It is made into un-leavened bread (roti) on 
top of a griddle or tava and eaten daily with meals. The 
roti is often stuffed with mashed vegetables then basted 
and  fried  to  make  the  famous  Punjabi  parathas.  Atta  is 
also deep fried into puris and bhaturas eaten mostly for 
breakfast with a potato or chickpeas curry. When cooked 
in a tandoor the atta is made into naans, tandoori rotis and 
kulchas. In winter makki roti or corn bread is eaten with 
saag ( mustard leaves puree) 

Rice is very popular in Punjab, but unlike the rest of India it 
is never eaten plain boiled. In Punjab rice is always served 
tempered with cumin seeds, caramelised onions and other 
spices. It is often eaten as pillao made with mutton, peas, 
or the outstanding gucchi (morrel). On special occasions 
the  sweet,  spice  and  saffron  rice  loaded  with  dry  fruit  
(meethe chawal ) is usually the star attraction. 

The  traditional  fuel  for  cooking  in  Punjab  is  cow  dung 
cakes (paathis). This provides low heat allowing the food 
to cook slowly; it also adds a smoked flavour to the food 
which enhances the taste. The paathis are used in chullas ( 
stoves ) made of brick and clay.

The tandoor arrived in Punjab with  the Afghans during 
the  Sultanate  period.  In  the  Mughul  period  it  became 
a standard fixture in the kitchens of the aristocracy. The 
tandoor is not part of any Punjabi kitchen, but a common 
tandoor  was  often  found  in  Muslim  villages  where  the 
ladies would bring the atta and get their (roti ) bread made 
for  a  small  payment.  This  tradition  died  out  with  the 
partition of India. The tandoor is now used in restaurants 
or whenever there is need to carter to a large number of 
people. The tandooria is skilled in making naan, kulchas, 
roti,  roast  eggplants,  legs  of  mutton  and  chicken.  it  is  a 
highly sought after skill.

The  most  popular  beans  in  Punjab  are  mah  dal  (  black 
matpe) , rajmah ( red kidney bean), channa dal (split small 
chickpea),  kabuli  cholay  (large  chickpea),  rongi  (  black 
eyed beans ) and moog dal. Whole beans are soaked for 
a while, often overnight and then cooked in water on low 
flame for a few hours till the mixture becomes creamy. It is 
then tempered with caramelized onions, tomatoes, garlic, 
ginger and garam masala and other spices. 

Some of the iconic dishes which are exclusive to Punjab 
are  :  makki  ki  roti  and  sarson  da  saag,  pindi  chole  and 
bhature, rajmah and jeera chawal, aloo parantha or gobi 
parantha  served  with  curds,  poori  chaane  with  lassi  ( 
sweetened  butter  milk),  tandoori  roti  and  dal  makhani, 
tandoori chicken, butter chicken, kulcha chana, kanji, dahi 
wale ladoo, wadi chawal, matter paneer, palka paneer, rau 
di kheer and meethe chawal.

Irrigated  by  five  rivers,  a  large  variety  of  fruits  and 
vegetables are grown throughout the year and form part 
of Punjabi cuisine. Punjab consumes a variety of pickles 
and  preserves.  Famous  are  the  mango  pickle,  the  black 
lemon  pickle,  the  gobi  shalgam  (cauliflower  and  turnip) 
pickle,  galgal  (hill  lemon)  and  ginger  pickle.  Carrot 
preserves (murabba) are a must have winter dessert, amla 

The Punjabi’s believe that a mother’s love can be tasted in 
the “churi” she makes for her children. Churi is a small roti 
on which 3 or 4 heaped tablespoons of powered jaggery 
(shakkar), with a generous amount of ghee is added and 
all three are then kneaded together with finger tips and 
lots  of  love,  to  make  the  sweetest  simplest  dessert.  In 
Punjab a good wish is often responded to by saying “tere

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiamoh mai ghee shakkar” ( may your mouth be filled with 
ghee and shakkar).

Food  is  the  most  important  part  of  all  celebrations  in 
Punjab, be it weddings or festivals. Festival food is often 
different  from  the  daily  fare.  In  the  peak  of  winter  the 
festival  of  Lohri  is  marked  with  much  joy  and  singing 
around huge bon fires. This festival is celebrated to thank 
God  for  surviving  the  winter  and  to  seek  blessing  for  a 
good harvest. Special food such as gajak, reyvari, peanuts 
with jaggery, puffed rice and sesame seeds are made on 
this  occasion.  These  are  all  first  offered  to  the  fire  with 
prayers and then served to family and friends. A special 
desert is made during this festival – rau di kheer (sugar 
cane juice rice pudding).

The festival of Baisakhi marks start of the new year (desi 
year, is named after king Vikramaditya and starts in 57 B.C  
is celebrated with anaarse – small round pancakes made 
of rice flour, sugar, milk , deep fried and garnished with 
poppy seeds.

70

The festival of Basant Panchmani celebrates the onset of 
spring. The pleasant weather brings out the kite lovers and 
the sky is filled with multi coloured kites battling to cut the 
other’s kite string. While the men indulge in aerial sorties, 
the women dress in yellow and prepare yellow coloured 
food such as, saffron rice, biryani and jalaibees. Festivals 
give Punjabi’s an excuse to indulge in their favourite sport 
– eating. 

No discussion on Punjabi cuisine can be complete without 
the  mention  of  “  Langar”.  In  Persian  the  word  langar 
means – ‘an alms house’ or a shelter for the poor and needy. 
In the 12th and 13th century AD, it referred to a kitchen 
attached to Sufi centres or Dargha, which fed all those who 
visited there. In Punjab this tradition was started by the 
Sikh Gurus and is now an essential to the concept of Seva 
(service)  in  Sikhism.  Guru-  Ka-  Langar  is  a  community 
kitchen run in the name of the Guru, it is usually attached 
to  Gurudwaras  all  over  the  world.  The  ingredients  are 
brought  and  cooked  by  volunteers  who  recite  prayers 
while  preparing  the  food.  When  preparing  and  serving 
the food, strict standards of hygiene are maintained. The 
meal  consists  of  dal  without  tempering  and  roti  (called 
parshadas), some langars add a vegetable to the menu on 
special occasions. The sangat (community) sits on the floor 
in lines and eat together; there is no distinction of class or 
caste. No food is allowed to be wasted, everyone finishes 
their food and cleans there thalis (plates) before leaving. 

In  the  20th  and  21st  century  the  Sikhs  have  taken  the 
langar to all places where humanitarian relief is required. 
Be it earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons or train disasters, 
they are the first to set up a langar and start feeding the 
traumatised disaster hit community. 

The langar is a true reflection of Punjabi cuisine. In Punjab 
food is wholesome, it is loved and it is shared. 

Traditional Cuisines of Tamil Nadu

M.G. Devasahayam, HART Ambassador, Tamil Nadu

For  centuries  Tamil  Nadu  has  been  dominated  by  the 
Dravidian  culture.  The  cuisine  of  Tamils  therefore  is 
distinctly  different  from  that  of  the  north,  which  is 
primarily wheat-based. The classic foods of Tamil Nadu 
center around rice and lentils with liberal use of coconut. 
Though  equally  balanced  between  vegetarian  and  non-
vegetarian  delicacies,  Tamil  food  is  better  known  for  its 
mouth-watering  and  piping  hot  idlis  and  dosas,  which 
have  now  become  all-India  favourites  and  popular  in 
many  parts  of  the  world.  Both  these  are  made  from  a 
fermented batter of ground rice and lentils. For idli, the 
batter is steamed into small puffy disks while dosa batter is 
spread thinly on a griddle and cooked into a crispy crepe/
pancake type of a dish. Both dishes are traditionally eaten 
with coconut chutney and sambar, a thick soup of lentils, 
tamarind and vegetables. These are pure vegetarian.

A  Tamil  meal  is  traditionally  served  on  a  banana  leaf, 
with  each  dish  placed  in  a  particular  spot  on  the  leaf 

and designed to be eaten in a certain order, with specific 
combinations of the dishes mixed together with the fingers.

Before eating, a small portion of each food is set aside in 
the upper corner as an offering to God. Meals are taken 
seated on the floor, and traditionally, the host continuously 
replenishes any food that is finished until the diner folds 
his or her leaf in half. This tradition is fast vanishing. 

The best Tamil food is prepared at home by women who 
have learned the secrets of every dish and spice mixture 
from generations of mothers and mothers-in-law. Amma 
in Tamil means mother and even the most highly trained 
chefs  can’t  quite  duplicate  the  complex  mixture  of 
knowledge and love that an Indian Amma puts into her 
meals. 

Though  varieties  of  Tamil  vegetarian  food  are  spread 
throughout  the  state  with  its  flavour  spreading  to 
neighbouring  Kerala,  Karnataka  and  Andhra  Pradesh, 
the most popular cuisines are invariably non-vegetarian. 
Among these the, Chettinad cuisine takes place of primacy 
though  there  exist  equally  traditional  and  delicious 
cuisines- Kongunad and Nanjilnad. 

Seafaring	Chettinad	cuisine
The famous Chettinad cuisine is the traditional food of the 
banking  and  merchant  Chettiyar  community  who  made 
the areas of Ramnad, Karaikudi and Madurai their home 
centuries  ago.  Returning  from  their  travels  abroad,  the 
Chettiyars brought back home with them the flavours of 
the Far East, from as far as Burma. 

71

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaNo Chettinad meal is complete without meat, especially 
chicken,  lamb  and  prawns.  These  meats  are  marinated 
in masalas ground by hand to create aromatic and spicy 
dishes. Chettinad cuisine is replete with dried meats, kept 
in  the  sun  to  tide  over  the  harsh  dry  summer  months. 
These dried meats are then cooked gingerly with oil and 
doused  with  masalas  comprising  precise  amounts  of 
aniseed, fennel, cumin, pepper, cinnamon and cloves. 

popular dishes being Vazhaipoo Vadai (deep fried lentil 
balls with banana flower), Makka Chola Vadai (deep fried 
lentil balls with corn), Kongu Kaalan Varuval (mushroom 
fry),  Pallipalayam  Paalkatti  Varuval  (similar  to  panneer 
fry),  Kongu  Thakkali  Rasam  (tomato  soup),  Murungai 
Keerai Rasam (soup made with leaves of drumstick tree) 
and Pollachi Thengai Kuzhambu (golden brown coconut 
gravy cooked with badam nuts). 

“Chettinad food has a lot more meat in it than the Nanjilnad 
and  the  Kongunad  cuisines,”  says  culinary  expert  Jafar 
Sadiq. “The key is in the use of spices as far as Chettinad 
food is concerned,” he adds. 

Beyond	Chettinad…
Tamil Nadu is a multitude of geographical distinctions, as 
far as culinary expertise and tradition goes. As the coast 
and the hills exist side by side, their food too intermingles 
in  a  heady  aromatic  blend  that  leaves  the  food  lover 
gasping  for  more.  Chicken  Chettinad  might  well  be  the 
hot  favourite  in  restaurants  across  the  state  but  Tamil 
Nadu’s cuisines are not just about the Karaikudi variety 
of spicy, tangy masala-filled aromatic dishes. The foothills 
of the Western Ghats in the state as well as the southern 
shores lapped by the lazy waves of the Arabian Sea too 
have distinct cuisines of their own. These two regions are 
not known for usage of too much spice. The influence of 
Kerala is evident, as both of these regions fall along the 
border of the neighbouring coastal state. Welcome to the 
lesser known, but equally delightful cuisines of Kongunad 
and Nanjilnad. 

Kongunad –Food of the Western Ghats
Kongunad  refers  to  the  area  along  the  western  regions 
of  Tamil  Nadu  –  the  areas  surrounding  Coimbatore, 
Kangayam,  Tirupur,  Pollachi,  Salem,  Erode  and 
Namakkal.  The  soft-spoken  Kongus  make  a  variety 
of  dishes  equally  soft  on  the  palate.  Some  of  the  most 

Kongu  food  is  synonymous  to  the  coconut.  Most  dishes 
in Kongunad cuisine have coconut in some form – be it 
roasted and made into paste or freshly grated coconut or 
even coconut milk. Sesame seeds, groundnut and roasted 
turmeric  are  essential  ingredients  of  the  Kongu  kitchen. 
These are then stirred together with coconut oil and fresh 
chicken or lamb to create mildly spiced, aromatic dishes 
that are easy to eat and digest. 

Unlike  the  Chettinad  version  of  dishes,  Kongu  cuisine 
uses only fresh meat. No marination is done beforehand 
and dried meats are seldom used. This brings a heady and 
fresh taste to the various dishes cooked in the western belt 
of Tamil Nadu. 

“Kongunad cuisine is milder, more nutritious and they use 
a variety of locally grown cereals like millets, ragi, black 
gram and horse gram.” says culinary expert Jafar Sadiq, 
Managing Partner at Jacob’s Kitchen, a popular chain of 
restaurants in Tamil Nadu which serves up delectable, little 
known Tamil fare. Sadiq and his late partner Jacob Sahaya 
Kumar  traveled  and  researched  little  known  traditional 
cuisines  of  Tamil  Nadu  for  14  long  years.  “Chicken  and 
mutton are more popular since the area is not very close 
to the sea.” 

Kongunad cuisine is also a reminder of the historic foods 
of  the  Tamils  of  western  Tamil  Nadu.  Millets  are  used 
extensively, giving a flavour of the earth at the foothills of 
the Western Ghats. Tamarind too is used liberally, an anti-

72

oxidant, that grows in abundance in the area. A plethora of 
pulses and cereals are used in almost every signature dish 
of  the  Kongunad  region.  Cashew  nuts  and  almonds  are 
soaked and ground into creamy paste, forming the base 
for thick delectable gravies that are eaten with millets and 
coarse rice. 

A  specialty  of  the  region  is  the  Navathania  Soup  (soup 
made  of  nine  grains).  This  combines  millets,  corn,  ragi, 
wheat,  black  gram,  horse  gram,  green  gram,  chana  dal, 
field beans, pepper, coriander and curry leaves to bring a 
tasty and healthy soup to the table. 

Kongu desserts are an absolute treat to the foodie. Local 
ingredients  are  used  innovatively  to  create  sweets  that 
simply melt in the mouth. Palmyra and coconut form the 
base for many sweets exclusive to the Kongu region of the 
state. It is impossible to resist the Pathaneer halwa (sweet 
dish made of palm fruit juice) and Elaneer Payasam (sweet 
kheer  made  of  tender  coconut)  which  are  a  couple  of 
famous and mouth watering specialties of the Kongu belt. 

However, if you are a vegetarian, do not fret. The Kongu 
region  grows  and  supplies  fresh  vegetables  to  the  rest 
of the state as well as to neighbouring states. Fresh leafy 
greens,  mushrooms,  corn  and  carrots  are  locally  grown 
and when added to the famous cashew based gravy of the 
region, bring out the bursting flavour of the land. 

Cuisine  of  Nanjilnad,  the  Land’s  End  of 
India 
While the most popularised variety of Tamil food is indeed 
the Chettinad style, the Nanjilnad cuisine is distinct for its 
taste  and  its  breadth  of  dishes.  Populated  by  the  Nadar 
and  fisher-folk  communities,  Kanyakumari  region’s 
proximity to neighbouring Kerala has brought in a taste of 
the western coast in its food as well. 

The people of this region speak both Tamil and Malayalam 

fluently. Their lifestyles too are shared, with hard work and 
excellent education being the hallmark of the Kanyakumari 
native. Fishermen head out to fish in the Arabian Sea at 
daybreak and at nightfall, they return with fresh catch of 
tuna,  salmon,  sardine  and  the  locally  beloved  pomfret. 
Fish is the staple here and residents of Kanyakumari add 
seafood to almost every gravy and dish in their menu. 

Coconut too is another staple, like in the Kongunad cuisine. 
The gentle swaying of coconut and palm trees of Nanjil 
landscape  forms  the  perfect  setting  for  a  mildly  spiced, 
nutritious  food,  rich  in  protein  and  fibre.  Ginger,  green 
chillies  and  garlic  bring  out  the  fresh  flavours of  locally 
available ingredients, creating heady concoctions hard for 
the food connoisseur to resist. “Since the Nanjilnad food is 
heavily influenced by Kerala, the taste is mild and lots of 
vegetables are added along with fish in the food,” explains 
Sadiq. 

These  dishes  of  fish  and  coconut  are  accompanied  by 
the Kerala variety of rice. This rice is thicker and harder 
in  texture  than  the  traditional  rice  of  Tamil  Nadu.  This 
reddish  brown  rice  is  steamed  in  water  and  the  starchy 
broth left behind is consumed as an accompaniment to the 
meal. Beef is eaten in these areas, another influence of the 
neighbouring state of Kerala. 

The  Ulunthuchoru  (rice  and  black  lentils)  is  not  to  be 
missed when you head to the coasts of Kanyakumari. This 
is one of the traditional Nanjilnad dishes and is served in 
accompaniment with Varuthu Araicha Thovaiyal (roasted 
coconut chutney). Aviyal (stew) made with egg and fresh 
vegetables as well as Kerala’s famous Pappadam (papad) 
add to the high protein value of the tasty meal. 

A  speciality  of  this  region  is  the  variety  of  tapioca,  rich 
in  carbohydrates  which  can  double  as  staple  food  and 
sweet-dish and is good for making chips. Tapioca pearls 
are  referred  to  as  “Javvarisi”  in  Tamil  and  most  of  the 

73

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiadelicacies are cooked from this form of tapioca. During the 
famine  of  the  fifties  the  poor  in  this  region  survived  on 
tapioca as staple food.

One  of  the  few  spicy  stews  in  the  Nanjilnad  cuisine  is 
the Vendhaya Kuzhambu. Made of fenugreek, this thick 
aromatic  stew  is  spicy  and  perfect  with  Ulunthuchoru, 
the preparation of rice and black lentils. Theeyal is also a 
trademark dish of this cuisine, consisting of vegetables in 
burnt gravy. 

In the desserts department, Nanjil cuisine outdoes itself. 
Try  the  Kinnathappam,  a  traditional  dessert  literally 
meaning  ‘plate  cake’,  a  signature  dish  that  natives  of 
Nagercoil  love.  Made  of  white  rice  and  coconut  milk, 
kinnathappam  bursts  with  nutrition  and  carbohydrates. 
Its  cousin  is  the  Elayappam,  literally  translating  to  ‘leaf 
cake’. A mixture of rice flour, coconut, jiggery and spices 
are wrapped tightly in plantain leaves and steamed. Other 
festival  delicacies  are  crisp  and  crunchy Achu  Murukku 
and Mundhiri Kothu made of rice-paste, lentil and jaggery 
combination.

In sum, as is their language and culture, food of the Tamils 
is also ancient and rich. As they say ‘variety is the spice of 
life’. Tamil Nadu lives it to the full in its mind-boggling, 
spicy  and  mouth-watering  cuisine  of  main  dishes,  side-
dishes and desserts. These are to be tasted to be believed. 
Herewith  are  visuals  of  some  select  dishes  across  the 
cuisine:

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiaarchaeologists  and  now  housed  in  museums  possess 
immense heritage value. Made of clay, metal, alloys and 
also stone, they were used in the preparation of cuisines 
during the reigns of prominent empires and dynasties and 
reveal interesting details of the blending of that period’s 
culinary  habits,  agricultural  production,  economy  and 
infrastructural progress.

Excavations at the Indus Valley, one of the oldest and at 
that  time  a  highly  developed  civilization  in  the  world 
indicate that around 1500 B.C. the Aryans entered India. 
Over the ages, India witnessed the rise and fall of several 
empires - the Mauryas, the Guptas, the Slave dynasty, the 
Mughals and Sikh rulers of the North, the Marathas of the 
West and the Cholas, Pandyas and Cheras in the South. 

Starting  from  the  15th  century  onwards  ships  carrying 
Portuguese,  British,  French  and  Dutch  traders  started 
arriving  in  India.  The  British  later  colonized  and  ruled 
over India for about 200 years till 1947 when India gained 
Independence. 

Tracing  cooking  utensils  with  heritage  value  would 
necessitate  tracing  their  origins.  The  Bronze  Age  on 
the  Indian  subcontinent  began  with  the  Indus  Valley 
civilization.  Inhabitants  of  Mohenjo-Daro  and  Harappa 
developed techniques in metallurgy and produced copper, 
lead,  bronze  and  tin.  Artisans  produced  a  wide  range 
of  utilitarian  and  decorative  objects  using  specialized 
techniques  of  stonework,  ceramics  and  metallurgy. 
Copper, bronze and shell were used to make utensils. 

Wheat and barley were 
the  main  food  crops 
grown  by  the  Indus 
valley 
farmers.  Peas 
and  dates  were  also 
grown.  Cattle,  goats, 
sheep  provided  milk 
Brass pot of the Indus Valley civilization
and  meat.  Food  was 
cooked  on  hearths  and  grain  was  ground  to  flour  by 
rubbing a rounded stone across on top of a flat stone. Bread 
and porridge were part of everybody’s diet. Commoners 
thrived on vegetables and fish and the rich ate poultry and 
game.

During  what  is  called  the  Golden  Age  of  India,  that  is, 
the  Mauryan  and  Gupta  Empires,  during  the  320-550 
BC, pots and pans recovered from that period reveal that 
a high degree of skill and perfection was reached in the 
preparation of clay utensils, which were popular in daily 
domestic use. Influences of Buddhism, Jainism and later 
Islam  affected  food  habits  of  the  people.  Even  the  rock 
edicts of Ashoka supported the benefits of vegetarianism 
but the utensils in, which they were prepared, were not 
mentioned.

From  the  Mauryan  Empire  to  the  frequent  invasions  by 
Turco-Mongolian marauders into the country from around 
the 10-11th centuries and prior to the establishment of the 
Mughal Empire, Vasco Da Gama arrived in India in 1498 
leading to colonization of parts of India by the Portuguese. 
As with other cuisines, Indian cuisine absorbed the new-
world vegetables such as tomatoes, chilies’ and potatoes. 

Pottery  or  ceramic  ware  of  the  era  was  heavy  and  fine 
clay was used in making smooth surfaced vessels which 
were then painted in black over red. Coarse grey ware was 
meant for rough use such as cooking. The surface of the 
vessels was rough, coarse grey and decorated with incised 
designs. 

The  Mughals  (1526-1857)  introduced  Mughlai  cuisine  to 
India, the influence of, which spread from Kashmir and 
Awadh  in  the  North  to  Hyderabad  far  down  in  South 
India. The cuisine was different in each region but it was 
rich, aromatic and spicy. The cooking utensils used, that 
is the degh or degchi and handi were common as these

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiawere used in the preparation of traditional North Indian 
cuisine.

While the British were in India till 1947 they introduced 
a cuisine of their own. Anglo-Indian cooking was almost 
a culinary balancing act of local ingredients and foreign 
tastes. Mulligatawny, kedgeree, Indian curry powder and 
Worcestershire  sauce  are  all  products  of  the  British  Raj. 
The pots and pans used by the bawarchis cooking for the 
British were of Indian origin.

We  learn  from  history  that  not  all  food  was  cooked  in 
utensils.  The  hordes  of  Mongols  invaders  who  came  in 
search of riches to India chose to eat while in the saddle. 
They  gorged  on  chunks  of  meat  roasted  on  hot  slabs  of 
rock  or  on  skewers  over  logwood  fires  as  they  did  not 
find time to cook regular meals. From the 13th to the 16th 
centuries, the armies of Chengiz Khan, Taimur Lang and 
Babur  were  compelled  to  travel  long  distances  on  foot, 
horses and  camels to  reach  India. Those roasted chunks 
must have tasted like today’s barbecued steaks minus the 
sauces. 

There were other forms of unconventional cooking which 
are  prevalent  even  today.  The  Patthar  ke  Kebab  owe 
their  origins  to  the  erstwhile  nawabi  era  of  Hyderabad. 
Marinated lamb is cooked over a patthar (stone). A black 
granite stone about half-an-inch thick is heated over a bed 
of hot charcoal and the meat is cooked on the stone.

Another form of an “outdoor” kitchen is the khad (deep 
pit) style of cooking of Rajasthan. When hunting wildlife 
was not considered a violation of animal rights, members 
of  the  royal  family  would  set  out  on  a  shikar.  The  big 
game would be carried back to the castle by coolies, minor 
shikar such as wild boar, teetar (partridge), bater (quail) 
and rabbits were lunchtime fare for the hungry hunters in 
the jungle. 

80

In  the  khad  style  of  cooking  large  leaves  and  mitti  (wet 
earth) were used in lieu of a utensil. The heat source at the 
base of the pit was by burning charcoal covered with dry 
twigs and cow dung to provide the heat. The marinated 
shikar was tightly wrapped in the leaves, which were then 
coated  with  mitti  and  placed  in  the  pit  which  was  then 
covered with sand. After a passage of time the pit was dug 
up, the dried-up mitti crust was broken and the deliciously 
aromatic preparation, cooked in its own juices, was ready 
to  be  eaten.  The  Khad  khargosh  is  prepared  today  on 
special occasions replicating those shikar days. 

The Kashmiri preparation of Gushtaba and Rishta involves 
the pounding of pieces of boneless mutton along with the 
fat  with  a  wooden  mallet  on  a  wooden  block  overnight 
till the strands of mutton split and the mutton turns into 
mince which is used to form koftas.

Since  centuries  cooking  utensils  have  been  made  out  of 
different materials and defined shapes based on the dish 
to  be  prepared  in  them,  style  of  cooking,  temperature 
required  and  source  of  heat.  Utensils  of  different  eras 
were based on the local and regional agricultural produce, 
which was governed by the environmental surroundings 
such as climatic conditions, supply of water and quality of

stoves and metal utensils is followed by some villagers for their daily cooking.

the soil. Manmade influences included religious traditions, 
community taboos, caste distinctions and prevalent zaika 
(taste).   

 

 

 

 

 

All  these  factors  combined  to  define  the  cuisine  of  each 
generation, their cultural milieu, social philosophies and 
economic standing. Although cuisines, recipes, ingredients 
and styles of cooking differed from region to region, there 
was not much of a difference in the conventional designs 
of the utensils.

A reflection on the socio-economic system that prevailed in 
India centuries ago was that shelves of royal kitchens and 
the upper classes were agleam with silverware. Intricately 
worked serving dishes made of gold, silver and base metal 
belonged  to  those  classes.  The  metals  were  believed  to 
impart purifying and healing properties to the food.

Terracotta kitchenware was for ordinary people. In common 
use  in  the  clay-rich  areas  of  the  Indo-Gangetic  plains  of 
the North, these sun-baked vessels were environmentally-
friendly. They were ideal for preparing dishes over even 
heat. Cooking in earthenware vessels imparted a unique 
flavour to the food.

Those living in the eastern, western and southern regions 
used utensils made of various metals and alloys, the areas 
being  mineral  rich.  Another  reason  was  that  they  did 
not  break  as  easily  as  pots  and  pans  made  of  clay.  Cast 
iron cookware is heavy, doesn’t rust easily. Food cooked 
in them enhances the iron content of the food benefiting 
those with iron deficiency. 

Aluminum  was  introduced  in  India  in  the  earlier  1800s. 
Affordable, light and strong, it was a good conductor of 
heat but not a good cooking alloy as contact with strong 
acids,  alkalis  and  salt  from  food  caused  the  metal  to 
dissolve. Peetal (brass) is an alloy of tamba (copper) and 
zinc, while bronze (kansa) is an alloy of copper and tin. 

Copper and brass vessels react to acids and salt and can 
cause food poisoning. Therefore they must be coated with 
kalai (tinning) regularly.

Just  as  bronze  disappeared  during  the  1950s,  brass  and 
copper  utensils  have  also  been  replaced  with  stainless 
steel  cookware.  Superior  conductors  of  heat,  they  are 
rarely seen in kitchens today as they wear out easily and 
require kalai frequently. Till the 1960s the kalaiwallah was 
a regular visitor to all homes to bring a shine to the utensils. 
Popularity of stainless steel drove him out of business.

Copper is still used to clad the exterior of stainless steel 
cookware  for  heat  conduction  as  stainless  steel  is  not  a 
good heat conductor. Some cookwares use a sandwiched 
layer of aluminum at the base for uniform heating. Such 
vessels are called heavy bottomed.

Cooking utensils retained their original shapes even when 
the  material  used  in  their  manufacture  kept  changing. 
Down the ages recipes and tastes have changed, culinary 
preferences  and  perceptions  kept  shifting  but 
the 
conventional shape of the utensils has not altered. 

The type of utensils used in Indian kitchens for cooking 
depends on the dish to be prepared, ingredients and the 
style of cooking. A selection of cooking utensils includes: 

DEGH / DEGCHI: Not usually 
seen  in  modern-day  kitchens, 
this  brass  vessel  with  a 
spherical base tapering sharply 
from the middle and ending in 
a narrow opening allows steam 
to  condense  and  roll  back  into 
the  food.  Ideally  used  for  the 
traditional slow-cooking process today known as the Dum 
Pukht style of cooking.

is used for cooking Dum Biryanis over a slow fire, and for 
preparing curries requiring low heat. The handi has been 
used for centuries and has been handed down from one 
generation to another.

PATEELA / BHAGONA: A circular vessel made of brass 
or stainless steel. It has straight walls and a narrow brim 
and is used to boil milk or cook many types of dishes.

KARHAI:  A  shallow  wok  with  a 
round  base.  Traditionally  made  of 
copper or brass, it has generally been 
replaced  by  stainless  steel.  Deep 
frying,  sautéing  and  making  dry 
preparations are done in the karhai.

gravy preparations

CHAKLA  &  BELAN:  The  dough  for  chapatis  is  rolled 
out on the traditional chakla, a round board, and belan, a 
rolling pin.

TAVA: A round thick iron griddle with a slight concave in 
the centre, it is a must in most Indian households. Used for 
making rotis, chappatis and parathas.

SIL  BATTA:  The  sil  is  a 
flat  stone  and  the  batta  a 
cylindrical grinding stone. 
Used  pan-India,  having 
different  names, 
these 
grinding  stones  are  used 
to  prepare  chutneys  and 
spice mixes for cooking in 
the  North,  East  and  West  and  to  grind  soaked  lentils  in 
preparation for dosas and vadas by South Indians.

North Indian sil batta

TANDOOR: A  cylindrical  clay  oven  with  thick  walls  to 
retain the heat generated by burning charcoal at the base. 
Used  for  roasting  or  baking  tandoori  rotis,  vegetables, 
paneer (cottage cheese), marinated mutton and chicken.

82

BAGHAR: Small frying pan with a long handle, used for 
giving tarka (tempering) to dals and vegetables.

BOTI  (chopper),  CHULHA  (stove),  CHAKKI  (wheat 
grinder) have no utility in modern urban kitchens designed 
for stand-up operations. These are commonly used today 
by villagers in the rural belts of India. 

Museums  are  repositories  for  preserving  a  community’s 
heritage and identity. They serve to propagate a way of life 
that existed in the pre-industrialization days and provide 
a window to look into bygone eras, where royalty enjoyed 
manifold luxuries, when simplicity was part of rural life. 

The National Museum in New Delhi, Lothal Archaeological 
Museum, 80 km from Ahmedabad and the British Museum 
in  London  have  galleries  with  Indus  Valley  civilization 
artifacts and terracotta. 

A  museum  that  has  been  preserving  heritage  cooking 
utensils is the Vishalia Environmental Center for Heritage 
of  Art  Architecture  and  Research  (VECHAAR)  in  the 
vicinity of Vishalla Village restaurant in Ahmedabad. 

Brainchild of architect Mr. Surender C. Patel, it was built 
in  1981  and  has  more  than  3,500  Indian  pots  and  pans

that  were  crafted  by  local  potters.  Some  of  the  utensils 
on  display  are  more  than  1,000  years  old  and  include 
other kitchen-related memorabilia such as pots, pitchers, 
nutcrackers and betel boxes.

VECHAAR is an extensive collection of utensils that have 
evolved  over  different  periods  of  history  as  a  result  of 
changing needs and the environment. The range of items 
varies from plates made of leaves or a gourd jug to modern 
stainless  steel  and  glass  utensils.  Metal  utensils  include 
those  made  of  brass,  copper,  bronze,  zinc  and  German 
silver.

The  museum,  listed  as  an  “Attraction”  on  the  Gujarat 
Tourism  website,  is  an  effort  to  cherish  and  preserve 
India’s rich cultural heritage and rare artistic skills of our 
craftsmen.

In Pune the Raja Dinakar Kelkar Museum, founded in 1920, 
displays household vessels of the 18th and 19th centuries. 
The  vessels,  made  of  terracotta,  copper  and  brass,  were 
brought from Kerala, Gujarat and Maharashtra. Kitchen-
related  equipment  includes  copper  ovens,  spice  boxes, 
coconut  slicers,  metal  plates,  spoon  hangers,  etc.  in 
different shapes and sizes.

Much can be learnt about a people, their recipes, cooking 
process  and  tastes  from  their  cooking  utensils.  Ancient 
pots and pans, a slice of life of the times they were used 
in should be given a place in museums in all parts of the 
country.

I  suggest  that  small  museums,  such  as  VECHAAR  in 
Ahmedabad,  be  developed  in  other  states.  The  Ministry 
of  Tourism  needs  to  take  the  initiative  in  preservation, 
maintenance,  conservation  and  promotion  of  India’s 
culinary heritage. 

For a beginning, the first museum could be opened in the 
Indian Culinary Institute which will begin operations in 
2016-17.  The  Ministry  also  needs  to  organize,  as  part  of 
the research in Indian regional cuisines, documentation of 
the vessels in which specific dishes were prepared. This 
will help develop aesthetic awareness among the people 
and encourage them to seek newer tastes through ancient 
cooking practices.

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaA Brief Glimpse of the  
Mathur’s and their Cuisine

Preeta Mathur

“Eat,  drink  and  be  a  Mathur”,  was  the  catchy  title  of  a 
long  article  on  the  Mathur  community  that  appeared 
in  the  popular  illustrated  weekly  in  the  1960’s.  Though 
apt the statement is at best partly true, Mathur’s, one of 
the  12  branches  of  the  Kayastha  community,  have  since 
times long gone by, been well known for the high level of 
intellectual and cultural accomplishments. In recognition 
of this, Mathur’s found themselves highly sought after and 
respected  as  ministers,  generals,  judges,  administrators, 
lawyers  and  doctors.  Their  close  proximity  to  the  royal 
dynasty took them to the far corners of the country from 
Kashmir to Bengal to Hyderabad, where they settled down 
as highly respected members of those societies. In addition 
to all these refinements, another very progressive trait of 
the  Mathur’s  that  has  been  that  women  have  been  well 
educated,  highly  respected  and  talented  singers,  artists 
and culinary experts. The community has throughout time 
shunned socially reprehensible practices like dowry and 
other social abuses pertaining to women. 

With an open minded and positive attitude, it took little 
time  for  Mathur’s  to  adapt  to  local  conditions  wherever 
they  migrated  to  with  royal  founding  dynasties  and  to 
absorb local languages, customs and cultural influences. 
This impact is clearly visible in the cuisine popular among 
Mathur households in different parts of the country.

An  outstanding  example  of  this  integration  is  the 
Hyderabadi  Mathur’s.  A  few  families  were  part  of  the 
founding  entourage  of  the  Nizam  dynasty.  Ever  since 
then,  Mathur’s  have  held  high  and  influential  positions 

in  successive  courts  of  the  Nizams  and  to  date  carry 
the  title  of  ‘Raja’.  Today,  when  Mathur’s  of  the  North 
meet  their  Hyderabadi  brethren  the  comparisons  are 
just as remarkable as the contrasts. Their cuisine reflects 
the  dominant  local  impact  of  the  strong  preference  for 
chillies.  Well  known  Mathur  preparations  which  went 
to  the  Deccan  with  the  old  families  have  returned  with 
distinctive  characteristics  of  their  own  like  Garley  (deep 
fried  minced  balls  dipped  in  gram  flour  batter),  Tootak 
(non  veg  baked  kachouris)  and  Lukhmi  (stuffed  small 
pillow shaped savouries).

Similar, is the position of the old settled Mathur families 
of deep west Rajasthan around Jodhpur and Bikaner. My 
husband Viresh, who studied in Mayo college, Ajmer tells 
me  that  the  food  habits,  the  language  spoken  by  these 
families are more akin to the locals then to Mathur’s from 
Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. On the food front ‘Soolas’ are a 
popular preparation which consists of succulent, boneless 
pieces  of  chicken  and  lamb  which  are  barbecued.  The 
Soolas  are  first  marinated  with  raw  papaya  and  kachri 
to tenderise them. Then ‘dhangar’ (smoking) is given by 
placing 2 live charcoals in a small steel bowl. This is placed 
in the middle of the marinated meat. 2 cloves are placed 
on the cinders and 1 tsp ghee is dropped on them. When 
it starts to smoke it is covered with a lid. The smoke thus 
trapped  inside  incorporates  with  the  meat,  giving  it  an 
exotic smoky flavour.

Major  festivals  like  Holi,  Dussehra  and  Diwali  are 
celebrated by all Mathur’s wherever they may be located. 

84

Amidst,  great  joy  and  conviviality  among  large  family 
groups  with  plenty  of  food,  drinks  and  music.  Holi  has 
been  traditionally  been  associated  with  the  preparation 
and serving of Papri, Goojas and Kanji ke Bade.

Most  Mathur  families  can  trace  their  roots  to  several 
preceding  generations.  Accordingly,  different  families 
have  nuanced  and  typical  ways  of  observing  different 
socio-religious  ceremonies.  In  the  same  vein,  different 
families were well known for different food preparations. 
Since  these  were  handed  down  from  one  generation  to 
another the custodians jealously guarded them. Needless 
to say these rare culinary gems were hardly ever committed 
to paper and were handed down by word of mouth and 
over  kitchen  fires.  Mathur  cooking  is  distinguished  by 
the  subtle  blending  of  aromas,  flavours,  and  cooking 
techniques,  most  notably  ‘bhuna’,  ‘dum’  and  ‘dhungar’, 
which are sublime forms of culinary art. 

Some of the exotic Mathur dishes are Shabdeg in which 
meats  and  vegetables  are  simmered  overnight  in  a  pot 
over charcoal fire, Siri where goats head is cooked in exotic 
spices and Daulat ki chaat, a delectable winter dessert of 
whipped milk foam chilled in the nights stew.

In  Delhi,  the  traditional  Mathur  strong  holds  were  the 
lanes and by lanes of Chandni chowk, Nayi sadak, Chira 
khana,  Daryaganj  and  Jamna  road.  The  famous  Chuki 
matar (succulent tender whole green pea pods cooked in 
tangy masala) and Aloo ke kulle (boiled scooped potatoes 
filled with sprouts, pomegranate seeds, chat masala and 
lemon juice) are very popular.

In  Uttar  Pradesh,  the  small  and  only  Mathur  princely 
state  of  Daryabad  near  Lukhnow  is  celebrated  for  its 
exquisite and unique cuisine and in special snacks called 
‘Phale’ which are stuffed wheat flour savouries, tampered 
with  whole  red  chillies  and  fenugreek  seeds.  A  typical 

Mathur  preparation  Bari  Bauwa  Ki  Handi  is  an  earthy 
flavoured  chicken  preparation,  cooked  without  onions, 
in a new earthen pot/handi. The pot gives the chicken a 
unique  earthy  fragrance  and  flavour.  Another  popular 
vegetarian dish is ‘Takke Paise’- a relative of Gatte ki Sabzi. 
It is a versatile dish with a deft play of ingredients. Lovely 
Mathur adds soaked and pureed dried figs, Geeta Shankar 
adds  carom  seeds  and  kachri  and  my  mother  used  a 
portion  of  prepared  masala  and  yogurt  while  kneading 
the gram flour. Potli pulao, Yakhni pulao, Matar ki Tahiri 
and Ramchane ki tahiri are popular rice dishes.

Since the Mathur’s love for good food is a unique trait it 
would be interesting to note that some Mathur ladies who 
were  vegetarian  could  none  the  less  produce  the  most 
delectable  non  vegetarian  preparations.  A  case  in  point 
is  my  own  mother.  Though  a  vegetarian,  her  Pasandas 
(artfully beaten pieces of boneless lamb), roast leg, dum 
fish  and  patila  chaap  (lamb  chops)  were  to  die  for  even 
though  she  never  tasted  the  preparation.  Similarly,  my 
aunt in law cooked a unique melt in the mouth Raan which 
took 3 days of pounding, grinding, marinations and slow 
fire cooking before being brought to the dining table.

My  maternal  uncles,  a  leading  family  from  Patiala  were 
great hunters. I recall most wistfully my childhood visits 
to my maternal home in Patiala where I vividly remember 
my  uncle  emerging  from  his  mud  splattered  jeep  in  his 
shikaar  outfit  with  shoulders  drooping  from  the  weight 
of guns and all kinds of game meats. This was followed 
with  much  bustle  of  cutting,  marinating  and  cooking  of 
the game meats by family members among noisy scenes 
of  laughter,  shikaar  anecdotes,  drinking,  singing  and 
massive eating.

The Mathurs zest for life makes them one of the unique 
communities of our country.

INTACT RECIPES
yAKHNI/POTLI PULAO
Potli pulao is cooked like yakhni pulao. In potli pulao, a 
selection of aromatic spices is tied in a muslin cloth like a 
bouquet garni (potli) to prevent them from dispersing into 
the yakhni (stock) while boiling. The spice potli releases 
flavours which get incorporated into the lamb stock. The 
bouquet  garni  is  squeezed  to  pull  out  the  flavours  and 
then discarded. In yakhni pulao, the spices are boiled with 
the meat and later strained.

Divide  the  dough  into  walnut-sized  balls.  With  wet 
hands take a ball of the flour dough and spread it on 
your palm.

4.   Cup  your  palm  and  fill  it  with  1  tbsp  of  the  lentil 
mixture.  Press  the  fingers  over  the  palm  thereby 
sealing the lentil mixture inside.

5.   Grease an open wide pan and pour 3 cups of water and 
boil. Place the phale in the boiling water for 5 minutes. 
Turn the phale and boil for further 10 minutes. Make 
all the phales in a similar manner. Remove onto a plate 
and keep aside to cool. With a sharp knife cut each into 
3 pieces.

6.   Heat the oil in a wok (kadhai); add the fenugreek seeds 

and whole red chillies, saute.

7.   Add the cut phales and fry for 10 minutes till evenly 

brown.

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiafar  greater  food  security  but  enhanced  humans  ability 
to  undertake  longer  and  farther  journeys  and  became  a 
critical  ingredient  for  the  spread  of  humanity  when  we 
became seafarers.

Pickles also provided a source of vitamin C necessary to 
prevent  scurvy.  It  would  be  fair  to  say  that,  were  it  not 
for  pickles,  Christopher  Columbus  might  never  have 
“discovered” America. In his 1492 voyage, Columbus or 
more  precisely  Amerigo  Vespucci  (a  well-known  pickle 
merchant)  gave  rations  of  pickles  to  sailors  to  prevent 
them from getting scurvy, leading them to complete their 
voyage.

Pickling itself has had its own evolution. From a position 
of being a vital technology for food security it has refined 
into an art form.

India,  also  suffering  from  extreme  temperatures,  not 
producing  sufficient  vegetables  in  summers,  facing  crop 
failure  due  to  excessive  rains  or  draught,  long  and  cold 
winters  killing  crops  due  to  frost,  all  lead  to  fermented 
food or pickling as a necessity.

Indian pickles, as we understand them today, are all about 
taste.  The  use  of  the  regional  term  for  pickles  in  Hindi, 
Urdu,  Bengali,  Assamese,  Sindhi  and  Punjabi,  “Achar” 
creates in every Indian an instant expectation of a virtual 
barrage of contrasting yet complimenting flavors bursting 
on the palate triggering waves of serotonin in the brain. An 
Indian can never be said, to be a true Indian if his system 
does not demand Achar as a regular fare. It is a tribute to 
this special food that we define ourselves in terms of the 
kind of pickles we relish. While the common thread that 
unites all Indians is the famous Mango achar, I am likely 
to be from Andhra if I like Ghongura achar, a Benarsi if 
my favourite is spice stuffed Red Chilli pickle, a Gujarati, 
if  I  like  my  Gur  Kairi  (Young  mangoes  with  jaggery) 
or  Chhunda  (sweet  jaggery  grated  mango  pickle  with 

spices)  and  an Assamese  if  I  love  Jolphai  jola  aru  mitha 
aasaar”made with Indian olives.

The  greatest  custodians  of  our  pickle  heritage  have 
traditionally  been  our  grandmothers.  The  repertoire 
of  grandma’s  pickle  in  most  households  is  diverse  and 
unique.  In  many  ways  it’s  a  family  heirloom.  In  an  U.P 
Khattri  household,  to  which  I  belong,  is  known  for  the 
Khattri  Achar  and  we  our  proud  of  having  at  least  50 
different varieties of pickles ranging from “ caronda achar, 
lasoda achar, hing Ki Kairi, mitha khuchla, Aam achar or 
kathal achar, it’s almost mandatory to have at least five to 
six different kinds of pickles on the dining table.

Our baptism in pickle takes place very early in life. From 
early  childhood  Indians  are  exposed  to  the  exploding 
flavours that will stick to them for the rest of their lives. 
For  me,  the  sweet  “gudamba”  (jaggery  mango)  pickles 
that have a surfeit of fennel seeds in it with rice and Daal 
(lentil)  was  an  early  favourite. As  my  palate  matured,  I 
started to love the pungent hing (asafetida) mango pickle 
in  two  variations,  the  truly  sour  version  and  the  sweet 
and  sour  version.  Like  an  explorer,  I  discovered  that 
these pickles go really well with homemade crisp mathri, 
another Khatri favorite snack.

The kathal achar tastes best when eaten with Paranthas. 
But  Jackfruit  is  seasonal,  like  many  other  pickles  such 
as  lemon  pickle  in  winters,  mango  pickle  in  summers, 
vegetable pickles in mild winters etc. 

One of the most exotic achar is called the Mango Gilori. 
The large sized raw mangoes are de skinned, traditionally 
by an improvised de skinning “sepia”(a natural sea shell 
with  a  hole  in  the  center  and  rubbed  against  a  stone  to 
make the cutting edge sharp). Then, with a lot of dexterity, 
thin layers of the mango would be peeled, so that from a 
single mango a long piece of a thin layer of mango slice 
is  obtained.  Then,  a  specially  prepared  masala  that  has

Indian Pickles and Palate

Rattan Capoor

The evolution of humans as modern social beings is in a 
strange way inextricably linked to the history of pickles. 
More precisely, the art of pickling and its less appreciated 
role  and  contribution  to  the  development  of  modern 
humans. Let us go back in time to the age of the advent 
of  agriculture,  some  8,000  to  10,000  years  ago.  Homo 
sapiens  were  beginning  to  settle  after  some  150,000  to 
190,000 years of foraging for food as hunters and gatherers 

much like our cousin apes, thanks to the discovery of our 
ability to grow food by planting seeds. That was a defining 
moment  for  humans,  as  it  changed  the  fundamentals  of 
living. Now, unlike before, we had food security! It was 
not before another 4000 years later that humans, in the part 
of the world called India, started pickling. This discovery 
of being able to preserve food, for out of season use and 
more  particularly  for  long  journeys  enabled  not  only

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiasugar, garam masala, black pepper and salt is put in the 
center of this layer and wrapped around in the shape of a 
paan (prepared beetle leaf) and is then held together with 
a “clove”. The Gilori is then matured in a sugar and salt 
mix and when it matures in about three or four days in full 
sunlight, it’s a pickle to die for!!!

There are several methods of pickling and there are several 
pickling materials, the most common being mustard oil. 
Of course the main preservative is salt and every pickle, 
without exception has high amounts of salt. This includes 
the ‘sweet’ pickles too. In fact the salt and sugar proportions 
are  critical  in  achieving  the  fine  balance  that  defines  an 
achar. Where Mustard oil is used as a preservative many 
recipes require that the oil drown all the other ingredients 
in the pickle.

The sweet jaggery or sugar pickles have no oil and some 
recipes  require  the  pickles  to  be  cooked.  Yet  another 
method requires raw seasonal vegetables cut into pieces 
picked  in  mustard  seed  (not  oil),  salt,  sugar  and  some 
other spices. The vegetables are cooked by the action of 
salt,  sugar,  mustard  seeds  and  a  few  days  of  sunlight 
and  ready  to  be  eaten.  This  type  of  pickle  is  popular  in 
Punjab and Delhi where it is eaten in winters. Moreover, 
these pickles are also then indicators of the abundance of 
vegetables, fruits and special food produce of that specific 
season.

My love for achar finds me searching for artisanal achar 
wherever I go in India. Last year in Bhuj, on our way to 
the great Rann of Kutch, I found myself buying from an 
exhibition thirty types of pickles, some of them made of 
wild berries that I had never seen! Another year on a visit 
to  the  Himachal,  I  could  lay  my  hands  on  chicken  and 
mutton achar sold by the locals in the lower slopes of the 
hills as we went to Manali. In my childhood I had feasted 
on wild boar pickle that I faintly remember as being gifted 
by a family from the area below UP hills.

92

In a special way, pickles can be a complete replacement of 
vegetables and pulses. 

Pickles also democratic and secular. It cuts across religion 
and caste lines and is universal in appeal, whether in rural 
India, where most farmers will have achar and onions with 
their roti or urban India where any and every restaurant 
will present some kind of achar, to every household that 
will have a bottle ready on the table.

However,  all  is  not  well  with  the  state  of  health  of  the 
Indian pickle. The challenges to the diversity of pickles are 
a reflection of real life itself. Much like the rapid extinction 
of many species on account of anthropological pressures, 
the  diversity  of  pickles  is  threatened  by  the  limited 
offerings of commercial pickles coupled with the neglect 
of  the  new  generation  that  seems  to  be  disinterested  in 
carrying the family traditions partly due to lack of time or 
the hard work involved.

But  there  is  always  the  possibility  of  a  renaissance.  The 
more I think about it the more I get excited at the thought 
of  a  grand  “Indian  Pickle  renaissance  “  where  one  can 
expect  renewed  interest  in  the  traditional  art  of  pickles, 
experimenting  with  new  methods  of  pickling,  new  and 
exotic ingredients and even fusion of several styles. In this 
age of renewed creativity, we can expect first a trickle and 
then  a  barrage  of  new  enthusiasts  giving  new  meaning 
to  the  traditional  achar.  Over  the  last  two  decades, 
mainstream food is experiencing a renaissance of sorts and 
a fusion revolution. It is only a matter of time when the 
pickle will witness a similar renaissance. I hope it happens 
sooner than later. The traditional Indian pickles with then 
have its new cousins.

I am waiting for the cousins to arrive as I constantly seek 
and  savor  the  traditional  Indian  pickles  from  all  across 
India.

The Cuisine of Malwa

Pallavi Mishra

The  Malwa  region  has  geographically  and  historically 
been a land of plenty; be it the magical ratio of the rain 
and  shine  the  region  receives  or  the  bounties  of  nature 
one can see all around. At their heart, both the food of this 
region, as well as the people who prepare it, are simple, 
wholesome and full of the best gifts nature has to offer.

Traditionally, jowar (sorghum) was a staple cereal not just 
in  Madhya  Pradesh,  but  throughout  North  and  Central 

India,  but  after  the  Green  Revolution  in  India,  wheat 
has replaced jowar as the most important food crop. The 
districts of Western Madhya Pradesh and parts of South-
Eastern  Rajasthan,  that  constitute  the  region  of  Malwa 
grows some of the best wheat in the world. The Chandosi 
and  Sharbati  varieties  grown  here  are  second  to  none 
across the globe. The preponderance of wheat thus in the 
common man’s daily life is a natural outcome.

93

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiathe  base  of  the  traditional  breads  of  Malwa-  bafla,  bati 
or  the  more  common  roti.  In  villages,  wheat  is  soaked 
overnight and boiled in the morning to create a healthy 
munching option called ghuggri, which can be eaten sweet 
or savoury. Similarly, no festival big or small is complete 
without sweets made out of gur (jaggery) in combination 
with one or more cereals. Gur ki thuli is a kind of porridge 
made  of  broken  wheat  and  gur  is  especially  consumed 
on the occasion of Renuka Chaudas. Gaakar is a kind of 
caramelised hard biscuit made of roasted wheat flour and 
gur that is offered as Prasad in pujas associated with the 
Goddess and Lord Ganpati.

Being primarily agrarian, the people of Malwa follow their 
customs  and  rituals  fondly  and  keep  close  track  of  the 
changing seasons. The climate is mostly dry throughout 
the year, but the rainfall is very heavy. Added to that, the 
volcanic, clay-like soil of the region requires less irrigation 
because of its high capacity of moisture retention. In light 
of such conditions, most people store their food grains and 
pulses for use through the year while seasonal vegetables 
are  available  fresh  throughout  the  year.  Because  fresh, 
locally  grown  vegetables  are  plentiful,  Malwa  has  an 
interesting  culture  of  making  seasonal  specialties.  Every 
season  -  summer,  winter  and  the  monsoon  has  distinct 
delicacies that are enjoyed only at that time of the year and 
not otherwise. 

A typical snack of Malwa is the bhutte ki kees - made with 
grated  corn,  mustard  seeds,  plenty  of  chilies  and  lemon 
juice. In a sweet variation, it is also made with grated corn 
roasted  in  ghee  and  later  cooked  in  milk  with  spices.  It 
is a hearty and healthy comfort food served steaming hot 
on  wet  monsoon  days.  To  make  it  perfectly,  the  locally 
grown makka, or maize should be young and the grains 
should be soft and doodhia (milky). They should, in short, 
be harvested after the first rain shower. If by chance, the 
kees is made with ripe or dry corn, it loses its characteristic 
flavor and consistency. 

Bhutte	ki	kees
A typical recipe for Bhutte ke kees would be:

Ingredients
•  Grated Corn 1 and 1/2 cup
•  Gram flour 2 tablespoon
•  Green chilies 2 chopped
•  Asafoetida a pinch
•  Turmeric powder 1/4 teaspoon
•  Mustard seeds 1 teaspoon
•  Cumin seeds 1/2 teaspoon
•  Aniseed/saunf powder 1 table spoon
•  Red chilli powder 1 tea spoon
•  Salt to taste
•  Sugar 1 teaspoon
•  Lemon juice from 1 lemon
•  Coriander leaves (for garnishing)
•  Oil/ghee 2 tablespoon

Method
Grate corn cobs and set aside. Heat oil/ghee in a pan. Add 
cumin seeds and mustard seeds to it and allow them to 
splutter.  Add  Asafoetida  and  Gram  flour  to  it  and  stir 
continuously for 2 minutes. Now add Grated corn, green 
chilies,  salt,  sugar  and  turmeric  powder.  Mix  well  and 
cover the pan with a lid and cook in slow flame for 3-4 

minutes.  Stir  the  mixture  and  cook  again  for  5  minutes. 
Add aniseed powder and red chilli powder. Mix well and 
turn off the flame. Add lemon juice and chopped coriander 
leaves. Serve Hot.

Similarly, in summer, the mango season is much awaited. 
From March to June, as the temperature rises, the mango 
trees start to fruit. The kachchi keri (young unripe mango) 
is harvested and used in multifarious ways. Amolya is a 
sweet-sour dal made with tuar and kachchi keri. The keri 
is also used to make various kinds of chutneys, kachumber 
salad  (assorted  vegetable  salad)  and  a  special  kind  of 
vegetable called fajita. To make fajita, the pulp from the 
seed of the keri is extracted and washed in water or milk. It 
is then tempered with heeng, zeera, curry leaves, salt and 
chilli powder. This is a unique dish not found anywhere 
else, as is Rasaal, an astonishing preparation of rice cooked 
in freshly squeezed sugar cane juice. This is a traditional 
Malwi dish that has all but disappeared, even in villages.

Winter has its own typical food rituals. Chana (Garbanzo 
beans or chick peas) is sown at the onset of winter. A Malwi 
folk legend says that chana should be sown when the air 
is cold enough to solidify ghee. Fifteen days after sowing, 
young  shoots  bearing  tender  leaves  emerge  and  these 
are then used to make chane ki bhaji, a winter delicacy. 
Another typical wintery Malwi dish is gwar-pata ki bati, 
(bati  made  from  wheat  flour  and  aloe  vera)  commonly 
eaten  to  ward  off  aches  and  pains  associated  with  the 
winter months.

To  document  the  gastronomical  tradition  of  this  land, 
I  visited  Bada  Rawla  in  Juni,  Indore,  the  home  of  Rao 
Raja  Rao  Shreekant  Zamindar  and  his  wife  Madhavi, 
descendants  of  Rao  Raja  Chaudhary  Nandlal  Mandloi, 
who established the city of Indore in 1716. 

At  Bada  Rawla,  I  had  the  opportunity  to  taste  and 
photograph  some  of  the  common  and  some  uncommon 
delicacies,  which  grace  the  kitchens  of  Malwa  homes. 
The first thing that strikes you as you look closely at the 
multitude of dishes made here, is a predominance of food 
grains- be it bajra (millet), jowar (sorghum), makka (maize) 
or  genhu  (wheat).  Cereal  is  cooked  in  whole,  processed 
and  semi-processed  form,  alone  or  in  combination  with 
other cereals, in sweet as well as savoury form. It forms

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional  Malwa  food  has  elements  of  Rajasthani, 
Gujarati  and  Maharashtrian  cuisine,  and  this  is  very 
evident from the overwhelming use of tempering agents- 
sesame,  desiccated  coconut,  curry  leaves  and  mustard 
seeds  that  have  found  their  way  into  dishes  made  in 
most households. Centuries of Maratha rule have led to 
puranpoli  and  shreekhand  being  sweets  that  are  found 
in  households  across  the  region.  However,  besan  ki 
chakki  (sweet  made  of  gram  flour)  and  nakti  ke  laddu 
(Boondi laddu) are the dishes that are to be found in any 
religious ceremony or celebration or wedding. The typical 
Maharashtrian  breakfast  dish  of  pohe  (flattened  rice)  is 
a hot favourite of Malwi people and some estimate that 
an approximate three truckloads of pohe is consumed in 
Indore alone, every single day!

Pohe
Rajasthan  finds  its  way  into  the  food  of  Malwa  in  the 
generous use of spices, particularly red chilli powder. A 
species of red chilli called Nimari mirch is grown here and 
is famous for its colour and aroma.

The  influence  of  Rajasthan  is  also  seen  in  the  love  for 
dal- bati and dal-bafla. There are two distinct differences 
between  the  Rajasthani  version  and  the  Malwi  cousin. 
Firstly,  in  Rajasthan,  the  bati  (wheat  bread)  is  baked 
underground over coals and dung cakes and then soaked 
in ghee, while in Malwa the bafla is first boiled in water 
and  then  baked  over  the  dung  cakes.  Secondly,  the  dal 
made along with bati in Rajasthan is a mix of five lentil 
varieties, called pachmeli dal, whereas in Malwa, only tuar 

dal is used and the taste has a hint of sweetness as well as 
the distinct sourness of tamarind (imli) and is called khatti-
meethi dal. The Rajasthani dal bati will almost always be 
accompanied by gatte ki sabzi, kadhi and choorma. This is 
not compulsory in Malwa, where dal bafla is a complete 
meal in itself. There is also a difference in shape, bati being 
almost spherical, while the bafla is disc like, almost like a 
doughnut or bagel.

Many of the traditional foods of the region are also closely 
associated with the vrats (fasts) and teej tyohar (festivals 
and  religious  ceremonies)  that  are  followed  as  per  the 
Hindu calendar. The large number of fasts that people keep 
very faithfully has led to a highly developed repertoire of 
vrat  cuisine.  Sabudane  ki  khichdi  (dish  made  of  tapioca 
sago), aloo ka kees (savoury grated potato), chonki mirch, 
rajgir  ka  halwa,  etc.  are  dishes  created  with  love  and 
reverence so that one can feast in their fast.
Thali for Vrat ( Fasting)
Some  unusual  customs  associated  with  food  are  also 
followed in Malwa. Halchat is an occasion in September- 
October  in  which,  only  those  vegetables  or  grains  are 

cooked  that  have  been  untouched  by  a  hal  (plough). 
Separately, in Chaturmas, a period of four months when 
the  Gods  are  believed  to  retire  from  the  earthly  world 
into  slumber,  certain  rituals  are  followed  by  the  royal 
households  of  Malwa,  like  the  Zamindars’  which  forbid 
the  intake  of  baingan  (Brinjal)  and  methi  (Fenugreek). 
This  ban  is  lifted  on  the  festival  of  Dusshera,  when 
baingan ke pakode (brinjal fritters) are made along with 
kadhi (spiced curry made of yoghurt and gram flour) and 
offered as prasad to the Goddess, and the vegetables can 
be consumed henceforth. Dishes made for the Royals were 
often tempered using a gold guinea, as it is believed that 
gold and silver have restorative powers.

Being  mostly  vegetarian,  the  people  of  Malwa  have 
developed innovative recipes that are uniquely Malwi, out 
of staples that are found all over our country. The food is 
rustic, flavourful and very wholesome. Everything is fresh, 
grows  locally  and  the  quality  of  produce  is  superlative. 
Traditional recipes have been created to suit the seasonal 
harvest. The cuisine, in essence is a true reflection of the 
benevolence of nature on this land.

International 
Earth  Day  Network 
Environmental NGO that has grown out of the first Earth 
Day  based  in  USA,  forty  five  years  ago.  One  can  only 
imagine  the  need  in  the  1970’s  for  such  an  organisation 
seeing  our  own  country’s  pathetic  pollution  and  neglect 
of resources. In India, this NGO now engages over 50,000 
organizations  in  over  192  countries  around  the  world 
to  broaden,  diversify  and  energize  the  environmental 
movement.  In  2010,  EDN  opened  an  office  in  India.  A 
meeting by chance with EDN India Director- Mrs Karuna 
Singh  at  an  organic  bazar  at  Kolkata  led  us  to  have 
Madhya Pradesh’s first organic mela at Gwalior. She had 
mentioned that they wanted to start their work in Madhya 
Pradesh  and  I  offered  our  premises  free  as  the  cause  of 
cleaning and greening the environment is very dear to me. 
Her commitment to the NGO is hundred percent and her 
team tirelessly works in different parts of the country with 
students,  women  and  the  community.  ‘Go  organic’  is  a 
major program EDN runs in India to build awareness of the 
benefits of organic and natural food and lifestyle products 
by  providing  platforms  to  bring  together  manufacturers 
and sellers of these products with the consumers. 

I  have  been  brought  up  to  love  nature,  despite  a  very 
modern educational background. Listening to the sounds 
of  a  flowing  stream,  chirping  of  birds,  crossing  rivers, 
climbing  mountains,  sitting  in  silence  out  in  the  open 
under  a  canopy  of  stars,  meeting  local  families  and 
learning  about  conservation  of  the  environment  at  the

grass  roots  level,  respect  for  nature  –  even  landslides; 
making  puddings  with  the  help  of  flowing  Himalayan 
streams  without  a  refrigerator  are  memories  which  can 
never fade! Now I zealously guard 30 species of birds that 
nest in our campus, which is within city limits and despite 
the frantic pace of this century, I have strived to get my 
children to experience these wonders of nature- flora and 
fauna whenever possible. Now that I am based in Gwalior, 
I thought it would be an excellent idea to try wean more 
people away from plastics, chemicals and unhealthy living 
in our chaotic yet historic city- Gwalior!  

EDN  was  happy  to  have  our  17th  century  home  set  in 
25  acres  as  their  venue  to  start  their  Madhya  Pradesh

through the press and stalls by organizations dealing with 
food and life style products to remind people that there is 
an alternate choice!

with the ‘Char Bagh’ and ‘Baradari’ to the Maratha period 
‘chhatris’  of  our  ancestors  and  our  family  temples  and 
then on to buildings like the zenana which were used for 

 
important state meetings during the freedom struggle to a 
 
Spanish style hacienda, which was the former ‘mardana’ 
             
now our home. The zenana, which was converted into a 
community school by my late mother in law Lady Jadhav, 
has  now  been  converted  by  me  into  a  hotel  run  by  the 
Neemrana  group.  Visitors  are  always  amazed  at  how 
five generations of the Jadhav family, one of the big five 
Sardar families of the erstwhile Gwalior state have used 
these premises. Sardar Deorao Bhausaheb Jadhav and his 
son Sardar Krishnarao Deorao Jadhav, father of Maharani 
Sakhya Raja Scindia used this as a garden home for picnics 
with  overnight  halts  occasionally  in  the  zenana  and 
mardana  areas  while  they  continued  to  reside  at  Laxmi 
Vilas Rajwada. Their elephants and stables were housed 
here  too  but  with  India’s  independence  and  merger  of 
states my father in law Sardar Deorao Krishnarao Jadhav 
moved residence to the mardana.

The  piece  de  resistance  was  the  Royal  Organic  Buffet 
served  with  traditional  royal  dishes  made  from  organic 
and  natural  ingredients  provided  entirely  by  Down  to 
Earth and prepared by the cooks of the household. This 
lunch was attended by a large number of diplomats and 
their families and various Indian industrialists and their 
spouses who came from Delhi. It was a major success, as 
most of the guests had never tasted these special dishes.

The banquet at our home could not be termed so without 
serving  Barbat  -  a  mutton  dish  favored  by  the  Maratha 
armies  on  the  march.  It  is  a  typical  regional  dish  where 
meat  is  cooked  in  spicy  gravy  and  we  prepare  this  on 
special festive occasions like Dussehra. Another dish that 
served was Vade Komde - a chicken curry accompanied by 
traditional  savoury  doughnuts,  which  everyone  agreed, 
were  mouth  wateringly  delicious.  For  the  vegetarians 
there  was  Kadai  Bhindi  -  batter  fried  Okra  delicately 
flavored with dry spices, Aloo ka Achar - a tasty potato

or stuffed aubergine.

Our special rice pulao with cottage cheese balls called Gole 
ka Bhaat was also made. The Chapati is actually traditional 
triangular bread made with flour and oil. Various Farsans 
and Chutneys were presented as side dishes to complement 
the meal. The Mandodari Dal, named after Ravana’s wife, 
is made of lentils cooked with over 20 ingredients. For the 
not  so  adventurous  guests  Varan,  which  is  plain  lentils 
with a dollop of pure ghee, was served. 

Everyone  loved  the  Khamang  Kakdi  -cucumber  salad 
sprinkled  with  peanuts,  fresh  coriander  and  lime  juice. 
Finally the puddings- the all time favourite jalebis, made 
with saffron, flour and sugar fried in ghee and our chef’s 
specialty  phirni-  milk  and  rice  pudding  served  in  clay 
bowls were much loved especially with the foreigners and 
children.  The  special  dimensions  to  this  meal  were  the 
organic ingredients supplied to our doorstep by Down to 
Earth.

Guests took a round of the Mela purchasing, making notes 
and later drove off to see the Gwalior Fort, described as 
‘the pearl among the fortresses of Hind’. By evening it was 
time to say good-bye to our day visitors.

ITRHD
Earth  Day  Network  is  an  international,  environmental 
NGO that has grown out of the first Earth Day based in 
the USA, forty five years ago. One can only imagine their 
need in the 1970’s for such an organisation seeing our own 
country’s  pathetic  pollution  and  neglect  of  resources.  In 
India, this NGO now engages over 50,000 organizations in 
over 192 countries around the world to broaden, diversify 
and energize the environmental movement. In 2010, Earth 
Day Network (EDN) opened an office in India. A chance 
meeting with EDN India Director- Mrs Karuna Singh at an 

100

organic bazar at Kolkata led us to have Madhya Pradesh’s 
first  organic  mela  at  Gwalior.  She  had  mentioned  they 
wanted to start their work in MP and I offered our premises 
free as the cause of cleaning and greening the environment 
is  dear  to  me.  Her  commitment  to  the  NGO  is  hundred 
percent and her team tirelessly work in different parts of 
the  country  with  students,  women  and  the  community. 
‘Go  organic’  is  a  major  program  EDN  runs  in  India  to 
build awareness of the benefits of organic and natural food 
and  lifestyle  products  by  providing  platforms  to  bring 
together manufacturers and sellers of these products with 
the consumers. 

I  have  been  brought  up  to  love  nature,  despite  a  very 
modern  education-  listening  to  the  sounds  of  a  flowing 
stream,  chirping  of  birds,  crossing  rivers,  climbing 
mountains,  sitting  in  silence  out  in  the  open  under  a 
canopy of stars, meeting local families and learning about 
conservation of the environment at the grass roots level, 
respect  for  nature  –  even  landslides;  making  pudding  s 
with  the  help  of  flowing  Himalayan  streams  without  a 
refrigerator  are  memories  which  can  never  fade!  Now  I 
zealously  guard  our  30  species  of  birds  that  nest  in  our 
campus which is within city limits and despite the frenetic 
pace  of  this  century;  I  have  strived  to  get  my  children 
to  experience  these  wonders  of  nature-  flora  and  fauna 
whenever possible. And now that I am based in Gwalior, 
I thought it would be excellent to try wean more people 
away from plastics, chemicals and unhealthy living in our 
chaotic yet historic city- Gwalior! 

EDN was happy to have our 17th century home set in 25 
acres as their venue to start their MP activities. And this 
is  how  the  26th  September  Organic  Mela  and  Charity 
Banquet  came  about.  It  was  a  gentle  way  through  press 
and  stalls  by  organizations  dealing  with  food  and  life 
style products to remind people that there ‘is’ an alternate 
choice! 

Guests  came  in  from  Delhi  for  a  day  with  our  excellent 
connection  of  3  hours  and  15  minutes  to  the  capital  via 
Shatabdi.  Starting  with  a  tour  of  the  complex,  that  has 
been  my  husband,  Sardar  Dhananjayrao  Jadhav’s  home, 
comprising beautiful gardens and stunning architecture, 
we  took  the  guests  from  the  Mughal  era  with  the  ‘Char 
Bagh’  and  ‘Baradari’  to  the  Maratha  period  ‘chhatris’ 
of our ancestors and our family temples and then on to 
buildings like the zenana which were used for important 
state meetings during the freedom struggle to a Spanish 
style hacienda which was the former ‘mardana’ now our 
home. The zenana which was converted into a community 
school  by  my  late  mother  in  law  Lady  Jadhav,  has  now 
been converted by me into a hotel run by the Neemrana 
group. Visitors are always amazed at how 5 generations 
of the Jadhav family, one of the big 5 Sardar families of the 
erstwhile Gwalior state have used these premises. Sardar 
Deorao Bhausaheb Jadhav and his son Sardar Krishnarao 
Deorao  Jadhav,  father  of  Maharani  Sakhya  Raja  Scindia 
used  this  as  a  garden  home  for  picnics,  with  overnight 
halts occasionally in the zenana and mardana areas while 
they  continued  to  reside  at  Laxmi  Vilas  Rajwada.  Their 
elephants  and  stables  were  housed  here  too  but  with 
India’s  independence  and  merger  of  states  my  father  in 
law Sardar Deorao Krishnarao Jadhav moved residence to 
the mardana.

For  the  vegetarians  there  was  Kadai  Bhindi,  batter  fried 
Okra delicately flavored with dry spices, Aloo ka Achar, a 
tasty potato dish garnished with dry coconut flakes, and 
Bharleli Vangi or stuffed augerbine.

We made our special rice pulao with cottage cheese balls 
called Gole ka Bhaat. Our Chapati is actually traditional 
triangular bread made with flour and oil. Various Farsans

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaSikkimese Cuisine

A Melting Pot of Different Influences

Jashoda Chettri

There is something about Sikkim that makes it different 
from  other  hill  stations.  The  same  can  be  said  about 
Sikkimese cuisine. Sikkimese cuisine is different yet heavily 
influenced  by  cuisines  of  other  regions.  Interestingly, 
Sikkimese food is a perfect example of amalgamation of 
different  communities.  The  three  ethnic  communities 
of  Sikkim-  Bhutias,  Lepchas  and  Nepalis  have  shaped 
the  Sikkimese  cuisine.  Sikkimese  cuisine  has  also  been 
influenced  by  Indian  and  Tibetan  style  of  cooking.  One 
may  find  a  slight  variation  in  the  preparation  but  its 
essence remains the same. For instance, Sikkimese chicken 
curry would be less oily and little runnier than the typical 
chicken curry found in North India. 

Being a self confessed foodie, I consider myself fortunate 
to  have  been  born  in  a  place  where  every  meal  is  sheer 

indulgence.  Sikkim  is  legendary  for  its  peace  and 
hospitality.  For  me  true  hospitality  lies  in  practicing  the 
principle of ‘Atithi Devo Bhava’ (guest is God) in the way 
we treat and feed our guests- lavishly and generously. We, 
Sikkimese are known to indulge our guests in the best of 
food and the popular local drink chhang (alcoholic millet 
beverage). No social occasion is complete without a lavish 
spread  of  local  cuisine.  Sikkimese  cuisine  is  a  unique 
blend  of  vegetarian  and  non-  vegetarian  food  items, 
which  are  not  only  healthy  but  light  on  the  body  too. 
Momos (dumplings) are a good example of healthy food, 
as it contains no oil or artificial colour. After idlis, momos 
could  be  touted  as  the  healthiest  food  item  on  earth.  A 
very  special  feature  of  Sikkimese  cuisine  is  that  most  of 
the food items are procured from nature in lines of farm to 
plate concept. For instance, edible fern with chhurpi (local 

variation of cottage cheese) is a must try for anyone and it 
is an eternal favourite with the local populace along with 
sisnu  ko  jhol(stinging  nettle  soup).  Most  food  items  do 
not require extensive processing but that does not mean 
we  eat  raw  meat  or  vegetables.  The  cooking  method  is 
usually easy and simple. Fermented beans, bamboo shoot, 
gundruk and sinki (made from dried leafy vegetables) also 
give a distinct identity to Sikkimese food. Sel roti (a sweet 
doughnut  like  snack)  made  from  rice  flour  with  Nepali 
style aalu dum is a must try along with zeroh and khaabjay 
(deep fried snack made from refined flour and salt/ sugar).

Non-vegetarian preparations are equally sumptuous. Beef, 
pork, chicken and mutton are used liberally in Sikkimese 
cooking.  Karchi  marchi  (entrails  of  local  goat)  is  to  die 
for  while  pork  pickle  is  what  makes  you  salivate  at  the 
mere thought of it. Beef curry is ideally accompanied by 
piping hot steamed rice. The consumption of meat can be 
attributed to the fact that colder regions are more suited 
for its consumption. Rice is not only limited to regular rice 
but  a  highly  nutritious  rice  preparation  is  the  makai  ko 
chaykhla (maize grits rice). 

The  pyaaz  tamatar  ko  chutney  (onions  and  tomatoes 
cooked with slit green chilies) is to Sikkim what aam kaa 
achaar is to the rest of India. This tangy chutney goes well 

with both rice and rotis. Sikkimese people are primarily 
rice eaters but that does not mean we are averse to flour. 
Rotis are consumed too, though it might not feature very 
regularly in our meals. Phaapar ko roti (buckwheat flour 
pancake)  is  not  only  packed  with  nutrients  but  is  also 
easy  to  make.  Another  must  try  item  in  Sikkim  is  the 
dalley chilly (the round red and green chilies often called 
fireballs for the right reasons). Dalley paste and pickle are 
a hot favourite with both locals and visitors. Unsuspecting 
guests have been tricked to bite into one of those red ones 
only  to  realise  that  they  are  not  cherries.  Dalley  can  be 
super addictive!

Sikkimese people are nature lovers and we live in perfect 
harmony  with  the  nature  and  our  environment.  This  is 
reflected  in  our  eating  habits  too.  People  in  rural  areas 
are  adept  at  identifying  edible  natural  food  items  like 
mushrooms,  ferns,  berries  and  tuber,  roots  and  shoots. 
Sweet potatoes, yam, tapioca (known as tarul locally) are 
some of the favourites, which are best enjoyed with silaam 
ko  chutney  and  Temi  Tea,  the  organic  tea  produced  in 
Temi in South Sikkim. Sikkim has become the first Organic 
State  of  India  with  75,000  hectares  of  agricultural  land 
converted  to  certified  organic  land.  So  come  and  enjoy 
eating the Sikkimese way- the healthy way.

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaFood for the Soul

Arun Budhiraja

K. Bhaskaran Nair is a man of habit. Every morning, just 
after 5am, the 65-year old retired Mathematics professor 
steps out of his house and walks the short distance to the 
celebrated Guruvayoor temple. As is the prescribed norm 
for devotees to shrines in Kerala, he wears a stark-white 
mundu knotted at the waist with another unstitched white 
garment thrown over his bare shoulders. To some it may 
seem  to  be  a  regular  constitutional,  but  for  Bhaskaran 
the  early  morning  visit  to  the  temple  is  a  journey  into 
himself  one,  which  he’s  been  doing  each  day  since  his 
retirement. In many ways, it is merely a continuation of 
a habit inculcated during his childhood, when, more than 
five decades earlier a young Bhaskaran would accompany 
his  grandfather  to  the  temple.  After  the  early  darshan, 
Bhaskaran would delight in the prasadam he would get. 
His favourite was the Trimadhuram, a syrupy and highly 
energizing mash of bananas, coconut, jaggery and honey.

His  grandfather  has  been  gone  a  long  time,  the  temple 
town  of  Guruvayoor  bears  little  resemblance  to  the  tiny 
hamlet  it  was,  but  Bhaskaran’s  love  for  Trimadhuram 
is  intact  and  it  goes  beyond  the  taste.  Today,  Bhaskaran 
understands  the  nuances  of  the  shrine’s  offerings. 
Guruvayoor,  like  all  major  Hindu  temples,  has  a  strict 
method in its rituals and practices that follow an age-old 
code. Offerings and temple food change in accordance to 
season and vary in type in keeping with the time of the 
day. If the Trimadhuram is made early morning, there is a 
sound reason for it. The Trimadhuram, and its companion 
offering Malar, though light in eating, are high in energy 
and hence, form the perfect start to the day. Easy to digest, 
crunchy, yet soft, sweetened with jaggery and honey – the 

104

healthiest sweeteners. There can be no better way to rev 
up  the  human  body  for  the  day’s  work.  Had  the  same 
offerings been consumed in the evening, digestion would 
have been a challenge. 

Cut  to  another  time  of  the  day  and  we  find  the  pattern 
repeated.  Between  11:30am  and  noon,  Guruvayoor  once 
again sees the most appropriate temple food being offered 
to God and later served as prasad to devotees. A variety 
of  paysams  are  offered,  mostly  rice-based  and  rich  in 
nutritious  coconuts,  bananas,  jaggery,  ghee,  cardamom 
powder,  refined  flour  –  the  ingredients,  their  quantity 
and cooking processes changing from paysam to paysam. 
While  this  sumptuous  offering  must  surely  delight  the 
Gods, a clear practical objective is clearly observed: that 
of ensuring devotees a filling prasad at a time that is close 
to lunch. 

This remarkable meeting of the spiritual with the practical 
is witnessed in temples across India. In the region of Braj, 
which is as distinct from Kerala as can be imagined; temple 
food  follows  similar  –  though  not  identical  –  patterns 
of  keeping  up  with  seasons  and  time  patterns  during  a 
day.  While  the  high  energy  giving  makhan-mishri  is  an 
all-season  offering  in  the  Mangala  prahar  prior  to  7am, 
winter has its own charms, such as the Daulat ki Chaat. 
In the latter offering, full cream milk is heated in a heavy 
bottomed pan and once thickened slightly, mishri, elaichi, 
cream  and  kesar  stirred  in.  Most  interestingly,  this  mix 
is left uncovered under the stars on a cold winter night. 
Before dawn, cream of tarter is added and whisked rapidly 
to form mounds of froth. This heavenly mix, also known 
as Nimish, is popular in Varanasi too.  

The  next  time  band  is  the  Shringar  prahar,  lasting  from 
7:30  to  9:30am.  Staple  fare  in  temples  across  North  and 
Central India is the ever-popular peda, which appears in 
a variety of flavours. The main ingredient is khoya, which 
is  based  in  condensed  milk.  An  alternative  appears  in 
Vrindavan’s Radha Raman temple, where the kuliya is a 
popular prasad. The kuliya is a small earthen pot in, which 
the  prasad  is  given.  Milk,  mishri,  elaichi,  pods  of  green 
elaichi  crushed,  kesar  and  pista  come  together  to  form 
a  soft  grainy-textured  sweet,  which  is  eaten  with  one’s 
fingers. A delightful and energy filled way to kick off the 
day.

In  the  Gwala  prahar,  also  called  Madhyahn,  which  lasts 
from 9:30 to about 11am, buttermilk keeps the body cool in 
summer. The Braj region throws up an interesting regional 
variant in winter, called Dhuan Chaach. The earthy, smoky 
flavour keeps buttermilk aficionados in good cheer even 
during  winter  mornings.  Then  there  is  the  Lapsi.  At 
Shrinathji,  in  Nathdwara,  it  is  based  in  thooli  –  cracked 
wheat or dalia. Added to it are milk, water, mishri, elaichi, 
badam,  pista  and  ghee  –  a  heavenly  and  filling  magic 
potion  to  satiate  a  devotee  in  the  morning.  While  it  is 
offered all year round in Nathdwara, down South it is a 
summer offering. In Udupi, it is the Rava Lapsi that holds 
center-stage. 

The  one  prahar  of  the  day  when  God  is  offered  a  truly 
sumptuous  spread  is  the  one  in  the  forenoon.  The  Raj 
Bhog  is  the  main  meal  of  the  day  post,  which  the  deity 
takes an afternoon siesta. Balanced and complete in every 
way, it includes two kinds of vegetables – prepared in a 
way that one is dry and the other has gravy. In the Govind 
Devji temple in Imphal, Manipur, kheer is served with a 
small portion of black rice. The contrasting colours are a 
visual  delight  while  the  complementing  textures  soothe 
the palate. In yet another instance of marrying the spiritual 
with the practical, devotees are served black rice only in 
small quantity as this high protein and carbohydrate food 

is difficult to digest. The best things truly come in small 
quantities! 

The  11:30-12  noon  prahar  also  finds  Guruvayoor  at  its 
delicious best. The Navakam Paysam, Pal Paysam, Palada, 
Erriti  Payasam  and  Paradi  Paysam  add  an  amazing 
dimension to the day. In contrast, the rather plain looking 
ghee  arno  made  in  Puri’s  Jagannath  Temple  surprises  a 
visitor with a burst of orange flavor. Also surprising is the 
same shrine’s namak khichdi. In fact, rice-based offerings 
form the staple for this prahar across temples. Just as there 
are  various  forms  of  khichdi,  there  are  also  many  types 
of bhaats, ranging from the Meva Bhaat and Dahi Bhaat 
made in Braj to Shrinathji’s Aamras Bhaat and Shrikhand 
Bhaat. Given that this is the biggest meal of the day, food 
like dal, kadhi, kashiphal ki subzi all find a place, as do 
different forms of raita and sweets like murabba and fruit 
rasa. 

Given the importance of food in temple life, it comes as 
no surprise that most shrines have anecdotes built around 
Raj bhog food. Take the case of Imphal’s black rice. Deep 
purple rather than black, this was also called ‘forbidden 
rice’ as it was consumed only by Chinese emperors and 
not commoners. 

Another example is Vrindavan’s arbi, prepared in devotion 
of  Krishna’s  favourite  gopi,  Radha,  on  the  occasion  of 
Radha Ashtami, the recipe of this dish is kept a secret by 
the Goswamis. In Mayapur’s Jagannath temple, the Lord is 
said to love katahal (jackfruit) ki subzi. Local oral traditions 
state that once a nearby farmer complained that someone 
from the shrine was stealing his jackfruits at night. He laid 
a trap in his field using wire meshes. The next time he saw 
his jackfruit missing, he found a bit of blue cloth on his 
trap and rushed to the temple. The priests were puzzled 
at  how  Balram’s  blue  dhoti  had  developed  a  tear.  Truly 
mysterious!

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaAt around 4pm, deities are believed to awake from their 
siesta, fresh for the devotees of the evening. First comes 
the  Utthapan  prahar,  which  lasts  till  5:30pm.  This  is 
followed  by  the  Sandhya  bhog,  which  ends  at  6:30pm. 
While  coconuts  are  offered  during  the  Utthapan  prahar, 
sandhya is time for the Lord to savour a refreshing drink, 
especially  if  it  is  summer.  While  the  saunf  sharbat  is 
staple  fare,  aamras  and  aaam  ka  panna  are  also  widely 
offered. Braj has its own specialty in the form of munakka 
sharbat,  made  of  raisins  dried  in  a  special  way.  Equally 
distinct is the phoolon ki thandai made in Varanasi’s Kashi 
Vishwanath  temple.  The  kharbooze  ka  panna,  tarbooz 
ka  panna  and  sattua  are  equally  refreshing  too.  After 
sunset,  the  nature  of  the  offerings  transforms  yet  again. 
Between 6 and 7:45pm, it’s time for sandhya aarti and for 
a snack. Namkeen chana dal in Varanasi, adrak ki bati in 
Braj, crispi kharkhari in Nathdwara and chakuli in Udupi 
delight devotees, possibly as much as they do for the Lord 
himself.

The last prahar of the day is the Shayan bhog, which ends 
at 8:45pm. Offerings are light and are meant to aid smooth 
digestion. High on spices like pepper, this acts as the day’s 
last meal for devotees. Shrinathji has a rich offering at this 
time with food ranging from mirchi ka saag, thapari, leelve 
ki poori, khasa poori and more. Poori and aloo, in different 
variants  are  popular  across  most  of  India.  Kachori  vale 
aloo at the Kashi Vishwanath are matched by Braj’s sookhe 
aloo  ki  subzi. A  day  that  began  with  delicious  offerings 
ends on an equally taste bud-friendly note. 

To those who believe that the proof of the pudding is in the 
eating, when it comes to temple food, it is actually in the 
cooking. After all, food prepared in a temple is first offered 
to the deity to satisfy a hunger that is spiritual. Thus, food 
becomes sanctified prasad. Cooked in enormous quantity, 
it  is  available  for  distribution  to  hordes  at  devotees  at 

106

popular shrines, all of which have long traditions for each 
food item they prepare. Temple food is usually prepared 
by  male  members  of  the  family,  who  care  for  the  deity. 
Preparation  guidelines  are  strict.  Bathing  is  mandatory 
before entering the kitchen. Brahmin cooks normally wear 
a  piece  of  freshly  washed  white  cloth  tied  around  the 
body to facilitate easy movement. Talking while cooking is 
discouraged. Often, a thin mask is worn around the nose 
and mouth to ensure hygiene and purity. 

In the high-speed life of the modern era, it may appear that 
traditional practices associated with temples are gradually 
fading out. But to experience the essence of such practices 
one must travel to rural India and to smaller towns, where 
they  live  on.  Not  just  in  temples  but  in  the  hearts  and 
minds of priests and devotees. This is the soul of India, as 
it has been for hundreds of years.

To  conclude,  a  small  anecdote,  which  captures  the 
devotion  of  selfless  service  to  the  Lord:  Padmanath  Das 
was a sincere, though poor, devotee of Krishna. Each day, 
he would pile white chanas on a plate and offer them to 
the Lord. Once, when he had a few guests, they laughed 
at what he was offering as prasad. Picking up each chana, 
Das  explained  that  one  was  halwa,  another  a  jalebi  and 
a third a rasgulla and so on. To Das, each chana was the 
symbol of a different sweet that he offered the Lord. When 
the guests ate the chanas, the taste they savoured was not 
of a chana but of the sweets Das had mentioned. This is a 
testimony to the emotion that Das felt when he offered the 
chanas, in his heart each being representative of a sweet 
he  could  not  afford.  The  Lord’s  divine  acceptance  was 
signaled in the transformation of the chanas into sweets. 

Truly, food for the soul! 

The Gastronomical Trail of the

Tribal North East India

Ashish Chopra

‘Tribal’ – the word itself generates an immense amount of 
misnomers. Time and again the word has been associated 
with primitive ideas, practices and culture. However, I do 
hope this article is able to break some of the stereotypes. 

certain you will be far happier singing North, South, East 
and West than spewing a mouth-full of syllables! And for 
this particular issue, we will stick to what we call India’s 
Northeast.

It is not easy to be born in India and to be writing about 
food, let alone tribal food. My father was an anthropologist. 
Hence, I accredit my interest in tribes and culture to those 
genes. My trail of tribal food started almost three decades 
ago  when  as  a  child  I  would  accompany  my  late  father 
on many of his field trips to remote corners of Himachal, 
Kashmir and subsequently to the north eastern states. The 
food fabric of these regions became an integral part of my 
gastronomical quests. 

Although a large part of the tribal populace has integrated 
with the mainstream over time and has undergone a sea 
change in lifestyle, what has remained closest to its purist 
form  is  their  cuisine.  As  I  was  exploring  all  of  these,  I 
could also see a gradual unfolding of patterns, common 
threads and designs amongst tribal cuisine of all regions in 
India. In an age of growing animosity and apathy amongst 
human, tribal hospitality is a shining example for all. Their 
festivals,  dance  and  song  are  pulsating  with  power,  joy 
and enthusiasm for life.

Although tribes of the world are differentiated on the basis 
of six primary ethnic groups: Negritos, Pro-Australoids or 
Austrics,  Mongoloids,  Dravidian,  Nordics  and  Western 
Brachycephals,  for  the  sake  of  convenience  we  will 
segregate  them  on  basis  of  the  region  they  inhabit.  I’m 

North East India 
Northeast  India,  the  only  region  that  currently  forms 
a  land  bridge  between  the  Indian  subcontinent  and 
Southeast Asia,  for  me  is  home.  I  am  forever  enthralled 
by  the  brilliance  of  colourful  hand  woven  textiles,  the 
captivating  folk  heritage,  its  non-severed  umbilical  cord 
with nature and most importantly the wonderful variety 
of food that the region comprising eight beautiful states 
of  Arunachal  Pradesh,  Assam,  Meghalaya,  Manipur, 
Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura and Sikkim, has to offer. And 
it is a promise that it will be no less than a spiritual journey 
to walk through the lanes of these hills and discover what 
these people are made of. However, for this occasion, let it 
just be food.

While Indian cuisine has taken the world by storm with 
the ubiquitous curry, tribal cuisine avoids those very items 
that define Indian food: oil and spices. Peculiar, bland, hot, 
aromatic, healthy, fleshy, fatty – yes these adjectives can be 
used all at the same time for a northeastern tribal meal. 
While a meal is incomplete without a steaming platter of 
steamed rice, various green vegetables and predominance 
of meat and fresh water fish is obvious. The most defining 
part of northeastern tribal cuisine is the usage of minimalist 
spice. A chilli or two (enough for sparking the fire), ginger 

107

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiaand garlic, occasionally sesame and some local herbs are 
the ingredients to tickle your taste buds.

Love  for  the  Pungent  and  the  Heat:  Though  each  state 
has their peculiar culinary style, each of them definitely 
has a nose for the pungent aka bamboo shoot, fermented 
soya beans, fermented fish, and fermented meat amongst 
others. Bamboo shoot is used widely as a souring agent 
in almost all the tribes. Dried fish chutney is relished in 
almost every state. People in Tripura love their fermented 
fish preparation called shidal while ngari is a must have 
in  Manipur  (though  Manipur  is  largely  non-tribal;  it 
has a good segment of tribal populace). Fermented soya 
bean  popularly  known  as  akhuni  in  Nagaland,  kinema 
in  Sikkim  and  turumbai  in  Meghalaya,  is  a  significant 
ingredient,  used  to  create  a  pungent  aroma  in  various 
dishes, also used as a pickle. When I say pickle, an array of 
hot chilies is indispensable for me to mention. The world’s 
hottest chilli popularly known as Raja Mircha or the king 
chilli  has  various  names  like  U-morok  in  Manipur  and 
bhoot  jolokia  in Assam  and  is  widely  relished.  None  of 
the pork dishes for example, in a state like Nagaland, is 
complete without the flavour of this fiery chilli. I’d say, if 
you have a brave heart and a desire for fire, just ask for it. 
The variety of chillies found in this region is mind blowing 
– the bird eye chilli known as khud jolokia in Assam, the 
dalle of Sikkim are only the tip of the ‘hot’berg. 

Rice: Rice is fundamental to the cuisine. You have various 
kinds at that; the favourite of them all is the wild sticky 
rice.  Many  a  times  rice  is  prepared  in  hollow  bamboo 
tubes. Apart  from  steaming  the  rice,  they  prepare  them 
like  a  stew.  The  Bodos  of Assam  prepare  a  stew  out  of 
chicken  and  a  rice  powder  called  onla  wangkhrai.  The 
tribes in Meghalaya have a rice preparation called jadoh 
made  out  of  rice  and  pig  liver.  In  Arunachal  Pradesh 
too, like all other  states, rice is consumed at  every  meal 
and has different names; ekayi, tongtep, khautek, porok 
amin, dung poo are a few. Dals and lentils are also staple, 

108

however, the methods of preparation varies. Most of the 
times in the north eastern states, rice will be prepared with 
yam stem, bamboo shoot and other locally grown herbs.

Love  for  the  Meats  and  Fish:  These  tribes  smoke  their 
meat at home over their large kitchen fire, ferment them 
underground,  literally.  Well,  the  same  goes  with  beef, 
chicken,  fish,  snails,  shrimps,  silk  worms,  red  ants  and 
others. And of course it is not just peculiar to the Nagas 
but various other tribes of northeast India. For the tribes 
in Arunachal, killing mithun or the bison is the symbol of 
utmost valour and wealth. And of course eating it!

Like pork, chicken, duck and all other edible flesh, fish is 
also very popular and has variety of ways of preparation. 
Fresh  water  fish  is  barbecued  in  banana  leaves  in 
Meghalaya,  Assam  and  other  states.  Fish  intestines  are 
relished. Many people make mixture of rice powder or a 
handful of steamed rice and fish intestines and prepare a 
delicious preparation out of it. 

Technically Manipur is not a tribe-dominated state, as their 
prime inhabitants, the Maiteis, are staunch Vaishnavaits. 
However,  Manipur  also  has  its  fair  population  of  tribes 
namely the Kukis, Paiteis, Zilliongs etc. Singzu is a salad 
prepared from green vegetables, chick peas and ngari and 
is relished all over the state. 

Not  without  Veggies:  Despite  the  predominance  of 
protein in their cuisine, the people of northeast are heavy 
vegetable consumers as well, given the fact that they are 
grown  naturally  in  abundance.  Nagaland  and  Mizoram 
are  organic  by  legislation!  In  Sikkim  they  ferment  leafy 
vegetables like rayo saag, leaves of mustard, radish and 
cauliflower and sundry it for later consumption. They call 
these preparations gundruk and sinki. Sinki is prepared 
from radish taproot only. And of course, Sikkim is known 
all over for its cottage cheese. The Riyangs of Tripura love 
to cook their vegetables in hollow bamboo over charcoal 
fire. Just imagine the flavour it would exude!

Beverages  in  North  East:  What  do  these  intoxicatingly 
beautiful people do when it comes to intoxication? Why, 
they  brew  their  own  beer  of  course! All  the  tribes  have 
their recipes of brewing rice beer. As it is self explanatory, 
it is brewed from rice. Rice is soaked in water for several 
days to let it ferment. Few intoxication agents are added 
to  give  that  zing.  These  agents  are  mostly  local  herbs. 
In Arunachal,  the  local  rice  beer  is  called  opo  or  apong 
or yu, o or marwah. While in Assam it is called laopani 
or xaaz. Each tribe has their own method of distillation; 
however the raw materials are more or less the same. Most 
of the times, the rice beer is offered to the deities before 
consumption,  and  needless  to  say,  every  celebration  is 
pretty incomplete without serving rice beer.

But  of  course,  we  must  not  forget  that Assam  is  the  tea 
hub  of  the  world.  Though  the  people  involved  in  the 
laborious cultivation are the adivasis who were brought 
by  the  British  planters  some  two  hundred  years  ago 
from  the  Chota  Nagpur  plateau  primarily  the  region  of 
Bihar,  Bengal,  Orissa,  Jharkhand,  Madhya  Pradesh  and 
Chhattisgarh. 

Hence a huge number of Oraon, Mundas, Khariyas, Saoras 
have become completely engrained in the demography of 
Assam  and  follow  not  only  some  of  their  original  food 
habits, but also certain assimilated habits. Black tea which 
the people in Assam call laal saah (literally translated as 
red tea), is mostly consumed with jaggery and is extremely 
popular  in  the  villages.  Towards  the  Northern  part  of 
Arunachal Pradesh lies the great Himalayan range and its 
chill  and  the  mountainous  topography  definitely  makes 
butter tea extremely popular, especially in the districts of 
Tawang, Siang and Kameng.

As I say, it is never enough when it comes to food-be it 
eating, cooking or writing. I still feel a little incapacitated 
because  of  the  fact  that  there  are  several  things,  several 
dishes I had to give a miss because of the extensive subject 

matter.  Considering  the  fact  that  the  northeast  India’s 
demography is tribe dominated, time and space is always 
insufficient to talk of the legends. 

However I would like to share some gastronomical facts of 
some of my favourite North eastern states.

NAGALAND

Nagaland has about sixteen tribes and each has distinctive 
styles  of  cooking  to  offer.  Nagas,  relish  pork  and  beef, 
and many Nagas rear animals to be slaughtered at feasts. 
Mutton  is  not  consumed  at  the  same  scale  and  also  not 
reared  at  home.  They  also  keep  a  stock  of  smoked  and 
salted meat all the round year. 

A very significant feature of Naga food is that, it is very 
(very) hot. Raja chilies (and in a generous quantity), is an 
important (and sometimes the main) ingredient of almost 
all the dishes that they prepare. The spices are kept to the 
least and sometimes might have only salt and chillies. The 
simplicity  and  use  of  freshly  available  herbs,  makes  the 
Naga cuisine very distinct. 

Meat  is  cut  into  large  chunks  and  the  other  spices  used 
include ginger, garlic and mejinga seeds and onions (local 
ones which are again very hot). 

Festivals  all  the  year  round  are  associated  with  crop 
growing. Some festivals are peculiar to a certain tribe, like 
the  Angamis  (residents  of  Kohima),  celebrate  a  festival 
which symbolizes protection of life. This festival involves 
men doing all the chores, right from cooking to washing 
and  cleaning.  They  also  live  in  isolation  from  women. 
They believe this would strengthen the men folk. 

December  sees  celebration  of 
festival 
(Terhunyi),  where  Nagas  eat  beef  and  pork  and  have 
access to unlimited zou (home brewed rice beer). 

the  harvest 

109

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaTuluni,  another  harvest  festival  is  celebrated  by  Semas. 
Semas  are  the  inhabitants  of  Zunheboto  and  Wokha 
districts of Nagaland.

Akhuni (fermented Soya beans), is an important ingredient 
for  their  dishes.  For  the  Lothas,  bamboo  shoot  is  an 
essential ingredient of their dishes.

SIKKIM
Sikkim,  the  Himalayan  Mountain  state  of  India,  is  the 
most  recent  member  among  the  North  Eastern  states. 
Topography of this place is characterized by the presence 
of the most magnificent mountain chain in the world which 
includes  the  Khangchenjunga,  the  world’s  third  highest 
mountain which is worshipped by the local inhabitants as 
the protector deity to their land. 

Sikkim  has  a  cuisine  which  is  influenced  by  the  diverse 
inhabitants of the place. The Lepchas, Bhutia and Nepalese 
who reside here have given a very unique flavour to the 
food of this place.

Rice is the staple food like in the other states of this region. 
Meat  and  dairy  products  are  consumed  when  available. 
Various  fermented  food  and  beverages  are  part  of  their 
dietary intake. 

Gundruk  and  Sinki  are  traditional  fermented  vegetable 
products  prepared  during  winter  when  fresh  perishable 
vegetable  is  in  abundance.  Gundruk  is  a  fermented 
product  of  leafy  vegetable  such  as  rayo  sag,  leaves  of 
mustard,  radish  and  cauliflower.  Sinki  is  prepared  from 
radish  tap  root  only.  Gundruk  and  Sinki  are  sun  dried 
after fermentation and stored for consumption. This can 
be preserved for almost a year, and cooked when ever one 
wants it. Kinema is another fermented preparation (soya 
bean), has a chewy property with unique flavour, usually 
consumed  as  a  main  side-dish  curry  along  with  cooked 
rice in meals.

110

Another interesting preparation is Chhurpi , a traditional 
cottage cheese which gives a texture of a white soft mass 
with  mild  sour  taste.  Momo  is  popular  here  too  and 
prepared in the same way as the other states. Bamboo shoot 
is popular too, both the fermented and unfermented form 
of  bamboo  shoot  is  consumed. A  Nepalese  contribution 
to Sikkim cuisine is Saelroti which is prepared from well-
mixed  fermented  rice  batter,  deep  fried,  ring-shaped, 
elastic,  commonly  consumed  as  confectionery  bread  in 
festival and special occasions. 

Here  unlike  the  other  seven  states  people  do  eat  roti 
(bread) and prepare various types of pickles (achar).

MEGHALAyA

 Meghalaya literally means abode of clouds and being true 
to this it also has the wettest place on earth. The climate 
is pleasant all year round and is an ideal place to spend 
a  holiday.  Shillong,  the  capital  of  this  state  is  known  as 
“Scotland of the East”. The British colonials saw this place 
to have great resemblance with Scotland. And it was their 
place  to  spend  a  vacation  in  India.  But  the  local  food  is 
nothing close to the food served in Scotland.

Three main tribes are Khasi, Garos and Jayantias, and the 
foods  they  prepare  are  similar  to  rest  of  the  North  East 
region. Their favourite meat is pork; mutton and beef are 
not  very  popular.  They  have  some  mouth  watering  fish 
based dishes. Fish cooked in bamboo hollow, fish baked in 
banana leaves are a favourite among the people too. Spices 
and fat are again used sparsely, ginger, garlic, onions and 
green chillies is all that is needs to cook up the dishes from 
here.   

Among the three tribes there is slight variation in the style 
of  cooking.  Garos  use  lots  of  indigenous  soda  in  their 
cooking. Khasis have a liking to fermented fish dishes and 
also pork dishes. 

Apart  from  the  other  Meghalaya  specialty,  what  is 
indispensable is the importance of khwai (betel nut). A day 
for a resident of Meghalaya starts with a mouthful of khwai, 
betel leaf and chemical lime. It is also a vital requirement 
for  all  important  occasions;  in  wedding  ceremonies  the 
groom presents khwai, betel leaf, chemical lime, rice beer 
and new clothes to the eldest female member of the bride’s 
family.  It  is  also  offered  to  guests,  it’s  had  before  meals 
to create more appetite and after meal it said to help in 
digestion. Life here revolves around betel nut. 

In earlier days, when food was offered to a departed soul it 
was believed that it would help the soul in its journey from 
earth to the next world. After the arrival of Christianity, 
these  practices  have  ceased  to  take  place.  Now  Khasis 
prefer  to  have  a  tea  party  or  hold  a  grand  feast  after  a 
funeral.

TRIPURA
Native  people  of  Tripura  have  coexisted  with  migrants 
from Bangladesh and now they are more in number, but 
this  has  not  led  to  the  extinction  of  their  tribal  culture. 
Though  now,  the  tribes  have  started  using  pulses  and 
spices. 

Like the other states, the residents of this state too are not 
patrons of too much spice in food. Though they do like a 
little colour in their food, therefore use turmeric. 

Majority of the tribes still live in the interiors of Tripura 
while the Bengalis reside in the town of Agartala. Tripura 
does love shidal, a fermented fish preparation. Each home 
would  have  a  stock  of  this  fish  close  at  hand.  Shidal  is 
prepared  by  cleaning  the  fish,  adding  salt,  and  mustard 
oil and then it is put away in a clay pot for about a week 
or  till  it  reaches  a  certain  stage  of  pungency.  For  a  non 
native, to relish shidal, would be an acquired taste but for 
the native, shidal is a flavouring agent and also put in a 
number on vegetarian dishes. They like pork, mithun (a 

type of buffalo) and rear these at home.

Food  is  simple,  a  simple  meal  prepared  on  an  ordinary 
day, would be steamed rice, fermented fish (prepared by 
using  only  soda  and  ginger).  Degree  of  difficulty  wise 
almost all the dishes are a breeze. 

MANIPUR

Manipur  claims  to  have  the  most  number  of  dishes  in 
comparison to other North Eastern states. Also the cuisine 
is  the  most  evolved  one,  involving  more  than  the  usual 
boiling,  steaming  and  roasting  for  preparing  meals.  The 
dishes are spicier; require oil for cooking and also require 
more  elaborate  preparation.    Over  the  years,  Manipuri 
cuisine has been able to keep the original flavour of the 
traditional dishes. 

People  of  Manipur  are  mainly  the  Meiteis  and  people 
belonging to the hill tribes. Meteis are devotees of Hindu 
goddess,  Vaishnodevi  and  therefore  red  meat  is  not 
consumed  in  their  festivals.  People  belonging  to  the  hill 
tribes do consume a lot of red meat. Food here thus is also 
guided by ones religion. Meitei women enter the kitchen 
only after taking a bath. 

People of Manipur take pride in displaying their culinary 
skills.  Rightly,  a  typical  Manipuri  thali  could  consist  as 
many as 25-30 items, served on a banana leaf (for the plate) 
and bowls made from folding banana leaves in a certain 
way. Rice is served in centre and the bowls of dishes in a 
semi circle.

 Dishes are mainly various chutneys, lentil, and vegetable 
preparations like ooti, hawai-thongba, bora, kelli-channa, 
eromba,  pakoda  thonba  and  many  more.  Thongba  is  a 
word which is used after many dishes; it means vegetable. 

Chutneys  are  an  important  part  of  their  diet,  singzu, 

111

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiachutney  of  unripe  papaya  and  fermented  fish  is  very 
popular here.  An ordinary meal on a normal day could 
be of three or four items, and it may or may not have fish. 

People of Manipur do like non vegetarian food (especially 
fish) but it is not served on all occasions. Certain occasions 
like  utsavs,  call  for  food  to  be  prepared  by  Brahmins. 
These festivals are also the best time to taste the local food 
(vegetarian). Many of the festivals are similar to festivals 
celebrated in northern and western India. 

MIZORAM
Spread  across  rolling  hills  astride  the  tropic  of  Cancer, 
Mizoram  is  situated  at  a  limb  at  the  southernmost  tip 
of  India’s  North  East.  Historically,  its  landlocked  status 
and  relative  geographical  isolation  from  its  neighbours 
has meant that there has been little outside influence on 
its way of life. While the hordes of invaders that poured 
over the Khyber Pass greatly affected the culture of North 
India,  Mizoram’s  seclusion  has  left  the  native  customs 
relatively intact for centuries. The gastronomic culture has 
therefore  evolved  more  or  less  indigenously  with  some 
contributions from neighbouring Myanmar.

The  word  “Mizo”  is  used  essentially  in  the  context  of 
the  tribes  such  as  the  Lushai,  Hmar,  Paite,  Lakhers  and 
Reangs. Though a distinct common thread runs through 
the culinary habits of these various peoples, certain unique 
dietary preferences remain.

An important determinant of Mizo cuisine had been the 
hunter  gatherer  tradition  of  local  tribes.  The  verdant 
forests that surround most villages offer up a bounty of 
leaves,  roots,  nuts  and  mushrooms  that  provide  cheap 
dietary additions to food grown on the jhums. Women on 
their way to and from the fields keep topping up their em 
(baskets carried on the back with a strap over the head) 
with an assortment of this forest produce and firewood. 

112

In  addition,  many  people  maintain  small  green  patches 
outside their huts. A variety of plants, the tender shoots of 
which regularly harvested are grown in these little kitchen 
gardens. All  these  provide  an  abundance  of  ingredients 
that  are  readily  boiled  together  in  various  combinations 
and eaten with rice to produce simple meals. 

The  vast  local  knowledge  of  edible  forest  produce, 
availability  of  home  grown  vegetables  and  extremely 
simple cooking means that something is always in reach 
for the cooking pot and no one, however poor, goes hungry.

Mizo cooking is characterized principally by the general 
absence of spices. This can perhaps be explained by the 
geographical isolation of the state and the comparatively 
recent  advent  of  British  rule  followed  by  Independence. 
Unlike  many  other  parts  of  India  therefore,  traditional 
spices  have  not  found  their  way  into  the  gastronomic 
culture. Items like cardamom, cloves, pepper and cinnamon 
are therefore almost nonexistent in Mizo cuisine. Variety 
in taste is obtained by the addition of chillies, ginger, salt 
and tumeric besides flavouring of certain leaves and roots. 
Sa um (fermented pork fat) is a frequent addition to many 
vegetable dishes providing taste (odour to the uninitiated 
palate), besides the illusion of meat. This heady brew is 
prepared by boiling down pork fat to near liquidity. The 
concoction is allowed to ferment forming a liquid that is 
used  sparingly  for  months  to  come.  Bekang  (fermented 
soya) is another addition lending flavour to many dishes. 
Drying and smoking of meat and leaves is a major Mizo (if 
not North Eastern) habit. This practice ensures that certain 
food items like dried meat, bamboo shoots and yam leaves 
(bal) are available regardless of the season. The traditional 
Mizo hearth is often therefore anointed with an assortment 
of edible items like corn, yam leaves and chunks of meat 
or game hanging over the fireplace. Smoked pork (vawksa 
rep) is a Mizo favourite, its delicious aroma enjoyed alone, 
unspoiled  by  any  other  addition.  It  is  also  added  to  a 
variety of dishes.

ARUNACHAL PRADESH
Rice  is  the  staple  food  of  all  the  tribes  of  Arunachal 
Pradesh.  Dung  Po  (Steam  Rice)  is  the  most  popular 
version of cooking rice. Two brass utensils are used for this 
purpose. In this part of the world, the myth persist that 
food cooked in a brass utensils are always delicious. On 
the top, the rice is filled with some leaves to secure it from 
scattering as the pot is hollow from beneath and the 2nd 
pot is filled with water to generate steams to cook the rice. 
The cooked rice is wrapped in leaves to serve. Kholam is 
also another popular and unique process of cooking rice. 
In  this  method  a  bamboo  tube  is  used  instead  of  metal 
utensils.  The  rice  is  filled  with  water  in  a  custom  made 
bamboo tube measuring 21/2 feet in height than it is left 
beside the traditional heath with enough heat to cook it. 
Before eating the rice the outer layer of the bamboo tube is 
delicately incised.

Wungwut Ngam .. Chicken with rice powder is a delicious 
method of preparing chicken. The required amount of rice 
is fried till brown and than it is grinded to powder. The 
rice  powder  is  poured  in  the  half  cooked  chicken  with 
all  the  indigenous  ingredients  than  it  is  left  to  boil..The 
most extraordinary tribal cuisine is a soup called PASA, 
it is fish soup prepared from fresh raw fish. The head and 
tail  portion  is  chopped  off.  The  remaining  red  meat  is 
minced and a paste is prepared. All the ingredients like 
garlic,  ginger,  chilly,  makat,  pee  chim  khim,  phoi  hom 
(indigenous scented spice leaves) are grinded to make a 
paste. The paste of the fresh raw fish and spices are mixed 
and flavored with the juice of ooriam (Khumpatt) leaves 
which gives a tint of greenish color to the soup. It is said 
that during war time, tribal soldiers used to prepare this 
soup  instead  of  cooking  food  that  would  have  revealed 
their hideouts. The simple tribal recipes are endless; the 
aforementioned  are  the  most  common  cooking  method 
across the state. However, if one desires to taste the various 

tribal  delicacies,  then  one  has  to  travel  across  the  state 
because every major tribes of the state has many sub-tribes 
and each sub-tribe has different food habits and lifestyle. 

Belief and religion also plays a pivotal role in dictating the 
choice of food.

Food in Arunachal is very easy to prepare and reflects the 
simplicity of the people with the use of minimalistic oil or 
spices.

ASSAM
Well, to begin with, I needed a bit of help. I asked a very 
dear  friend  to  identify  a  few  green  leaves  which  were 
not  laai,  lofa,  paleng,  dhoniya,  podina,  matikanduri, 
maanimuni, dhekia, durun, khutora, narasingha, xoroyoh, 
jilmil and kosu ( these are Assamese names of the various 
popular  green  leafy  vegetables.)  She  wanted  to  give  me 
‘authentic’  information  and  called  up  her  mother  who 
sat with her grandmother on speaker phone to go really 
authentic  to  the  days  when  Assamese  people  actually 
used to have a hundred and one green leaves on the eve 
of  Bohag  Bihu  (festival  of  spring  or  new  life.)  Some  of 
the greens I learnt about were modhusaleng, rohbaghini, 
bonjaluk, xukoloti, pipoli, titabahok, borkosu, xetbhedali, 
bhumloti,  xewali,  keturihalodhi,  mermerilota,  tongloti, 
ghilalota, tengamora, long pasoli, brahmi, kolmou, xuka 
puroi,  monua,  masandari,  ponounua  amongst  several 
others. This is Assamese food; rustic, healthy, bland yet hot 
occasionally. The mouthwatering kosu xaak a.k.a colacacia 
leaves with lots of black pepper leaves your nasal cavity 
drained,  yet  enriches  you  with  a  marvelous  experience! 
If I consider the banana plantain to be one of the greens, 
then its stem known as posola is the next delicacy I have 
to mention. 

Though  we  cannot  categorize  the  Assamese  people  as 
carnivorous,  they  do  have  their  share  of  flesh  for  every

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiaspecial  occasion  be  it  a  duck  roast,  goose  curry,  pigeon 
meat, pork with spinach leaves and bamboo shoot or other 
‘lesser’ meats like chicken! Duck and goose are best cooked 
with kumura or the ash gourd. Also used is posola-the body 
of the banana plantain, as I mentioned earlier. Talking of 
Assamese food to the Assamese and not mentioning fish is 
like commiting hara-kiri or suicide. The blessed land that 
Assam is, the Brahmaputra and its tributaries and various 
other  fresh  water  resources  like  the  pond  (Pukhuri)  at 
your backyard, the paddy fields, the streams and springs 
are endowed with various kinds of delicious fish. Small, 
medium, big, all sizes and shapes are available. Small fish 
like  donikona,  puthi,  bheseli,  randhoni,  kholihona,  misa 
etc., medium sized fish like goroi, magur, kawoi, muwa, 
pabho, bato, tura, botiya, neriya and bigger ones like rou, 
borali, xitol, khoriya, sengeli etc. just tickle your taste buds 
with their umpteen flavours. Maas, as the natives call it are 
caught on jaakoi (straining contraption made of bamboo 
used  in  ponds  and  paddy  fields),  thuha,  khuka,  sepa, 
(bamboo traps placed in paddy fields), boroxi (fish hook) 
or zaal (fishing net). Fish is stored in a bamboo container 
called  khaloi  and  can  be  hung  around  your  waist  while 
fishing.

Maasor  tenga  (sour  fish  curry)  is  the  most  popular 
Assamese  fish  preparation.  Various  souring  agents  like 
ou tenga, thekera, tenga mora, local tomatoes, lemon etc. 
are  used  during  the  preparation  of  the  jool  (thin  curry). 
Minimal  spices  characterize  Assamese  cuisine.  Use  of 
chillies  like  khud  (pinch)/mem  jolokia  (referring  to  the 
spicey  flavour  despite  its  grain  size),  bhut  jolokia  (also 
known  as  Raja  Mircha-world’s  hottest  chilli.)  Pepper  or 
jaluk  is  common  be  it  in  fish  preparations  or  duck  and 
geese. Apart from curries, fish is relished deep fried and 
roasted  on  charcoal  fire.  Small  fish  like  puthi  is  roasted 
and mashed with mustard oil, salt, chopped onions and 
coriander leaves. The rustic cooking and impeccable raw 
flavour is simply out of the world! In Assam anything that 

114

is  mashed  is  called  pitika,  the  most  popular  ones  being 
bengena  (brinjal)  and  aloo  (potato).  All  Assamese  will 
swear by it. Potato is popular and it is customary during 
Magh Bihu (harvest festival) to have sweet potatoes (mitha 
aloo, muwa aloo, kath aloo etc.) while the morning meji 
(a  huge  customary  fire  during  Magh  Bihu)  is  lit.  While 
one mentions Bihu, not mentioning pitha will be criminal. 
Pithas  are  traditional  rice  cakes  prepared  during  the 
festive  season.  Both  sweet  and  salty,  pithas  are  dry  and 
either steamed or roasted while others are fried. Jaggery 
is  the  most  popular  sweetener.  Til  pitha,  gheela  pitha, 
xutuli pitha, sunga pitha, tekelir mukhot diya pitha, paat 
pitha,  muthiya  pitha,  pheni  pitha  are  few  that  I  think 
of. Til pitha is unique considering the fact that it is dry, 
has a black sesame and jaggery filling and looks like an 
oversized cigarette. The best way to consume, following 
the traditional way is by dipping it in ronga saah (literally 
red tea but is actually black tea.) While I am still talking 
about harvest and Magh Bihu-a Bihu that signifies a good 
harvest and of course is signified by having huge feasts. 
You will find all what I have discussed so far, all under one 
roof on a single day and of course much more. 

I have been mentioning duck and geese quite often and 
that’s  because  hanh  (duck)  and  raaz  hanh  (geese)  are 
regarded  delicacies  during  special  ceremonies.  You  can 
say,  they  are  the  ‘turkeys  of  Thanksgiving’.  While  local 
chicken  is  more  popular  for  day  to  day  use.  Gahori 
manxo or pork is the ‘forbidden’ meat and is nevertheless 
consumed by various communities and has different styles 
of preparation. There are some who store the pork in a pit 
while others cook it dry with crunchy spinach leaves.

Some use bamboo shoot or khorisa and make a curry out 
of it. The Ahoms have an old saying that if you did not 
have gahori on Bihu, then you will be born as one in your 
next birth. Probably it came as a mischievous story told to 
children in the families by the older ones and the legend 

spun itself hence forth. Paaro manxo or pigeon meat is also 
a delicacy. Two preparations are most popular-a dry one 
with koldil or the banana flower or a jool (curry) with lots 
of black pepper. As I write this, I am getting hungry by 
the minute, and I am waiting eagerly for my next golden 
chance to run to North East as always.

Ahoms and a few other communities have a tradition of 
consuming eggs of red ants (amlori tup) on Bohag Bihu-
the festival of spring. In fact, the eggs from the big nests 
on  mango  trees  are  the  best  ones  and  believe  me;  the 
boys  in  villages  have  to  undergo  quite  an  ordeal  with 
the red ant formic acid bites! What’s good food without a 
little adventure? However, I hardly see many youngsters 
enthusiastic  enough  to  go  through  the  same  ordeal  of 
celebration these days. Probably there are not many forests 
left to provide such scope. Or for that matter, community 
feasts  have  almost  become  a  redundant  concept.  Some 
people say that the sense of neighbourhood is gradually 
diminishing in Assamese society. 

Paan Tamul

Have I missed anything? Yes, a lot! I am not yet done with 
the  pickles,  tamul  (actually  tamul-pan;  a  combination 
of  beetle  nut  and  the  leaf)  and  the  legendary  xaaz  or 
laupani or the local rice beer. Like all other north eastern 
states,  Assam  also  has  its  traditional  rice  beer.  Various 
communities  call  it  by  various  names  and  with  slight 
change in the distillation process; it gives a little variation 
in the zing. Pithaguti (a cake of several herbs) and rice are 
the prime components all over. 

Here is a my one of favourite Naga pork recipes which I 
would like to share

Ingredients
750 grams pork
Fermented bamboo shoot (1 medium tablespoon)
Roasted red chilli powder (3 tea spoons) or the best option 
is Naga Raja chilli
Pepper  (10-15  flowers);  can  use  grinded  pepper  as  an 
alternative
Ginger (10 grams)
Garlic (5 big cloves)
Salt
Water…one cup..
To make curry paste
Make a paste of ginger and garlic and keep it aside.

Cut  the  bamboo  shoots  into  small  sizes  of  1  cm  each. 
Measure a 1 tablespoon bamboo shoot and keep it aside. 
Use the bamboo-shoot water minimally.

Preparation
Cut the pork into medium sized pieces and place it in a 
cooking pot. Add salt to it and enough water to immerse 
the pork. In a medium-high flame, cook the meat and salt 
for 30 minutes or until the pork is half cooked. Add the 
bamboo-shoot  along  with  its  water  and  stir  the  mixture 
until dry. Add some water and cook the meat until it is 
cooked or the water is almost dry. Add in the ginger and 
garlic paste, pepper (10-15 flowers) and chilli powder and 
stir for about 2-3 minutes. (Make sure there is just enough 
water  in  the  dish  so  that  it  does  not  burn.)  Add  some 
more water and let it boil for another 5 minutes. The curry 
formed should be medium thick. Serve hot with rice.

I  hope  you  enjoy  cooking  and  eating  this  as  much  as  I  have 
enjoyed writing it! Bon Appetit.

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of Indiaalmonds and cashew are ground with coconut and other 
Indian spices to make the Parsi curries, which accompany 
the afternoon rice meal in a Parsi home. Nuts and raisins 
are  also  fried  and  sprinkled  over  rice  pulao  and  other 
savory and sweet dishes.

The Parsis were those Persians who fled from the port of 
Hormuz in the Persian Gulf around 936 AD from religious 
persecution by Arab invaders. Food starts the Parsi story 
in India – when Jadi Rana, as told in the Kisseh-e-Sanjan 
narrative, gave a bowl full of milk to the priest who had 
come  to  ask  for  refuge  in  his  kingdom,  the  wise  priest 
carefully stirred in a spoon full of sugar. Thus the Parsis 
would act like ‘Sugar in the Milk’ of India, sweetening and 
strengthening the life of their adopted land while not letting 
it ever overflow. Jadi Rana, impressed by this symbolism 
granted  the  Parsis  refuge  and  freedom  of  worship  and 
life. As  can  be  seen  from  this  myth  and  in  real  life,  the 
Parsis brought from Persia their fondness for a touch of 
sweetness  even  in  their  savory  and  spiced  preparations, 
a preference they discovered, that they even shared with 
their Gujarati neighbours. Khata –Meetha, meaning sweet 
and sour is a term by which Parsis are identified.

What  is  Parsi  food  and  what  are  its  origins?  Food  is 
intimately associated across India with religious identity. 
Food is an offering made as ‘Chasni’ in Parsi fire temples 
and  homes  and  accompanies  prayers.  Zoroastrianism 
gives  great  reverence  to  nature  and  its  manifestations 
in  fruit  and  flower  accompany  all  rituals. A  particularly 
auspicious significance is given to the pomegranate, which 
symbolizes  immortality  and  abundance  and  is  therefore 
always part of the Chasni. 

Fish  is  auspicious,  often  used  today,  symbolically  in 
silver  representations  in  ritual  implements.  Standing  for 
fertility and abundance it is also specially made as ‘Mava 
ni  macchi’,  sweet  meats  in  the  form  of  fish,  which  are 
presented on family occasions of happiness particularly at 
Navjotes and marriages. 

For  the  Zoroastrian,  food  is  sustenance  to  strengthen 
mankind in the battle against evil. There is no fasting or 
abstention,  because  unlike  other  religions  of  India  both 
the  material  and  the  spiritual  are  equally  important  in 
the  Zoroastrian  tradition.  Pain  or  depriving  the  body  of 
nourishment is a sin and fasting is strictly prohibited. In

A Descriptive Account of Parsi Food 

Shernaz Cama & Vanshika Singh

The recent discovery by the general public in India of Parsi 
food is heart - warming and also a sign that Indians are 
now  ready  to  experiment  with  different  aspects  of  their 
country’s  vast  cuisine.  Parsi  culture  is  an  amalgamation 
of East and West; in dress and food influences come from 
their  origins  in  ancient  Persia,  their  links  with  China 

and the strong influences of the Gujarat coast as well as 
European culture. 

The spices used in this food reflect a combination of dry 
fruits  and  nuts  available  abundantly  in  Iran,  with  the 
coconut  and  spices  of  Gujarat  and  Goa.  Dry  fruits  like

this ‘Religion of the Good Life’, food plays an important 
role.  It  is  closely  intertwined  with  the  entire  life  of  the 
Parsi, beginning even before birth.

In  the  8th  month  of  pregnancy  the  Agharni  ceremony, 
performed for the expectant mother, has central to it the 
Agharni  no  ladvo.  Its  conical  form  and  almonds,  dates 
and dry fruits come from the Iranian tradition; the sweet 
ladoo comes from the Indian tradition. This ladvo is fed 
to  unmarried  women  in  the  gathering,  in  the  belief  that 
marriages will quickly follow. 

This ceremony is followed by a typical feast, which will 
include ravo (sweet semolina with rose water flavor), sev 

(sweet  vermicelli  with  dry  fruit),  white  rice  and  modi 
(plain or pure), dal- called tuvar in Gujarati and known as 
arhar across the rest of India. Fish dishes will accompany 
such family gatherings, but a European addition will be 
present in the form of a baked dish or a specially made 
savory pastry with some form of chicken or meat. 

This feasting finds its zenith in the famous Parsi ‘Lagan 
nu Bhonu’. Anyone who has witnessed the rows of white 
linen draped tables, shining green banana leaves, and huge 
silver  serving  dishes  being  carried  to  serve  exquisitely 
dressed  and  bejeweled  ladies  and  gentlemen  at  a  Parsi 
wedding feast understands how important feasting is in 
this culture.  

This  is  one  tradition,  which  believes  that  feasting  not 
fasting  is  the  way  to  appreciate  the  Spenta  (bountiful) 
creation that is, this world. Spread on palm leaves instead 
of plates, with silver cutlery and white linen napkins, this 
feast  can  include  up  to  twenty  dishes  and  will  always 
have the special lamb pulao with dhansak dal.  Made out 
of a combination of up  to eight  types  of dal, it  includes 
vegetables, meat as well as special spices, which create a 
dish unmatched in flavour and subtlety. 

A favourite during this special menu is the Patra ni maachi 
or  green  coconut  chutney  wrapped  with  banana  leaves 
around  steamed  pomfret  fish.  The  chutney  comes  from 
the traditions of the Gujarat coast, while pomfret is a fish 
valued both by the Zoroastrians of India and Iran.

The  death  rites  of  a  Zoroastrian  also  involve  food.  For 
three days after death, the hearth fire is not to be lit and 
the family is to be fed by the neighbours. For these three 
days they observe parhizi or abstinence from any form of 
meat. On the fourth day, when it is believed the soul or 
Urvan has entered paradise or garotheman, a special day 
of feasting is observed. Eggs are ubiquitous in Parsi food 
and the day starts with a poro or Parsi omlette, malido- 
a sweet and bhakra- a sweet fermented with toddy. The 
afternoon meal would include the favourite dishes of the 

departed soul and on this day of charum and dhansak is 
always made. Some believe that this is the reason dhansak 
is always eaten by the family gathering every sunday, in 
order to commemorate ones ancestors. 

Apart  from  life  cycle  rituals,  special  calendar  days 
dedicated to divine beings are also celebrated with food 
and reverence. On the ‘birthday’ of fire- adar mahino, adar 
roj,  each  household  specially  decorates  the  kitchen  with 
images of blessing, made of turmeric and kumkum paste, 
over and on the stove. The six ghanbars or festivals of the 
seasons are occasions where the entire community comes 
together and each area has a specialty dish, prepared on 
huge log fires even today. 

The  Iranian  New  year  falls  on  21st  March,  the  Spring 
Equinox,  symbolizing  the  arrival  of  spring  and  the 
rejuvenation  of  the  land  and  its  offering  of  grain,  fruits 
and  vegetables.  On  this  day,  falooda,  a  rich  milk  drink 
flavored  with  rose  water  is  prepared  for  the  special 
Navroze table set up even today across Iran, Central Asia 
and Parsi homes in India, welcoming the new season with 
a symbolic gathering of the fruits of the earth. Most people 
of  the  Middle  East  are  meat  eaters  and  the  Parsis  never 
could succumb to vegetarianism, even during their sojourn 
in Gujarat, a vegetarian strong hold. No Parsi meal would

be  complete  without  a

are that the meat, chicken

once  again  showing  a 
multicultural bias. 

The  preparation  of  Parsi 
food  is  not  simple  in  the 
modern  world,  perhaps 
this  is  what  led  to  the 
creation  across  Gujarat 
and  Bombay  and  later  to 
the  Deccan  and  Karachi,  of  Zoroastrian  Stree  Mandals. 
These were women’s organizations, where for now almost 
one  hundred  years,  special  dishes  such  as  dar  ni  pori, 
date  ghari,  bhakra,  malido  and  other  complex  dishes 
with ingredients which need special treatment and skill, 
have been prepared by women trained in the craft of Parsi 
food. In most Parsi areas or baughs, even today, women 
are  economically  employed  by  personal  sale  of  not  just 
this food but regular Parsi meals or dabbas. These are of 
great help in a demographically aging community, where 
often  there  are  no  young  people  to  help  prepare  food 
for  the  elderly.  The  Ratan  Tata  Institute  (RTI)  and  Parsi 
Amelioration Cooperative (PAC) have become important 
destinations not just for Parsis but for all those in Bombay 
who  enjoy  clean,  freshly  prepared  Parsi  dishes  in  an 
ambience of cheerful hospitality. 

The  RTI  is  a  charitable  enterprise  of  the  Tata  family 
started  by  Sir  Ratan  Tata,  son  of  the  founder,  Jamsetji 
Tata.  Inaugurated in 1929, the RTI celebrated its Platinum 
Jubilee in 2005; 75 years of commitment to help the less 

120

fortunate  and  disadvantaged  women  within  the  Parsi 
community and later all Indian women, by training them 
to  make  special  Parsi  food.  The  goal  is  to  offer  a  life  of 
dignity, which is not dependent on charity.  It has an outlet 
with a huge kitchen on Hughes Road in South Mumbai. 
The organization has Parsi and non-Parsi employees many 
who  have  spent  a  lifetime  working  with  the  RTI.  They 
provide  reasonably  priced  Parsi  meals  to  many  homes 
across Mumbai thus helping the elderly and the infirm. 

At  the  RTI  and  in  Parsi  food  the  menu  seem  unusual 
because the herbs of the Iranian plateau mingle with the 
condiments  of  India  creating  Parsi  Cuisine.  The  Parsis, 
as  stated,  are  an  intercultural  amalgam;  therefore  the 
language too, in the menu is often an amalgamation of two 
languages. A Parsi lamb roast, marinated in dahi (yoghurt) 
and spices was influenced by the English roast meat while 
baked dishes in white sauce and English sweet dishes such 
as the bread and butter pudding, caramel custard, cakes 
and blancmanges became part of Parsi food. The famous 
‘lagan nu custard’, served at weddings is an exotic blend of 
the bland English pudding with dry fruit, eggs, cardamom 
and other rich ingredients.

It  is  speculated  that  Parsi  men  invited  to  a  meal  in  an 
English home (in the early years women did not go out 
much)  would  describe  the  food  to  their  wives  and  thus 
would  result  the  Parsi  version  of  some  famous  English 
dishes.  One  such  was  the  baked  fish  in  béchamel  sauce 
which became the ‘machi no saas’, fish in a tangy white 
sauce, popular at weddings and parties.

relies  a  lot  on  bakery  products.  Historically,  baking  was 
an art, which had Iranian roots but was modified for the 
market by shrewd Parsi enterprise. Manufacturing units 
run by private family businesses came into being with the 
setting up of European ‘factories’ across Gujarat. One such 
family of which the sixth generation continues the baking 
tradition is the Dotivalas of Surat. 

So  many  English  dishes  became  a  part  of  Parsi  cuisine, 
that the classic Parsi cookery book, written by Mehrerbai 
Jamshedji Nusserwanji Wadia, ‘Vivid Vani’, written in two 
volumes during the late 19th century, has a total of 2050 
recipes,  out  of  which  700  are  English.  The  Parsi  ‘estew’ 
is  English  stew,  changed  to  suit  a  palate  more  used  to 
spices. The Parsi ‘cutlace’ is the western cutlet enormously 
changed by the use of spices and enough eggs to make a 
doctor wince. 

Parsi  food  tends  to  be  regarded  as  ‘rich’.  It  is  seen  as  a 
cuisine of the affluent, making use of expensive ingredients, 
dried fruit, apricots and extensive use of meats. However 
cooking for the household is normally simpler but is still 
regarded as a very important component of daily life. 

Irani  food,  which  came  with  the  Zoroastrians  who 
migrated across land in the 19th and early 20th century, 

The  Dotivalas  are  descendants  of  Mr.  Faramji  Pestonji 
Dotivala, who learnt to make breads from Dutch traders. 
The bread he made was fermented with toddy, to prevent 
it  from  spoiling  on  long  sea  journeys.  If  left  unsold,  it 
would become dry, with a light and crispy texture, which 
was sold cheaply to the poor. Faramji innovated making 
small round baked biscuits, which have today become the 
famous  ‘Farmasu  surti  batasa’.  For  over  three  centuries 
the Dotivala biscuits, now identified as Parsi biscuits, have 
included  the  Surti  batasa,  the  Nankhatai,  and  the  Irani 
biscuits. While their forte was fermenting the dough with 
toddy,  a  drink  much  favored  by  Parsis,  introduction  of 
prohibition in Gujarat took away that option. To recreate 
this  crisp  original,  the  Dotiwalas  again  innovated  to  get 
the same result. The light salty version, popular in Irani 
teashops, came to be known as Irani biscuits. Thus, sweet 
and salty Parsi biscuits have pioneered the baked goods 
industry in India.

were  situated  in  triangular  locations  bought  cheaply 
because  such  locations  were  considered  inauspicious  by 
the  local  population.  They  were  sensitive  to  the  Indian 
context and there are often boards and menus stating that 
beef and pork products are not sold on their premises. 

Today the Berry Pulao of Britannia Restaurant is famous, 
while Leopold is a regular gathering place of young back 
packers who come in for their substantial and reasonable 
food.  Britannia,  located  at  Ballard  estate,  is  deliberately 
maintained as a part of the lost British Empire. Mr. Baman 
Kohinoor at 92, personally entertains his customers. Old 

colonial nostalgia, portraits of Queen Elizabeth and three 
flags - Iranian, British and the Indian Tricolour grace its 
walls.  These  flags  epitomize  the  hybrid  culture  of  these 
people. 

Mr.  Kohinoor  in  an  interview  explained  ‘The  Iranian 
flag  represents  my  roots,  the  British  flag  represents  the 
patronage  given  to  the  Parsis  for,  which  reason  we  are 
affluent today and the Indian flag, represents my country’.

bakery  of  Pune  is  renowned  all  over  the  world  and  its 
famous  shrewsbury  and  ginger  biscuits  are  so  popular 
that only ‘one box for one person’, is a rule. There is no 
question of commercializing or bigger premises, the taste 
and  quality  lie  in  stringent  family  control  and  personal 
care is taken in the making of each product. 

A  young  face,  Anahita  Dhondy,  has  become  the  face  of 
the coming of age of Parsi food as up market, fashionable 
food and a place to be seen in. The Sodabottleopenerwala 
Restaurants,  started  by  the  chain  run  by A.  D.  Singh  of 
Olives, has not only conquered Gurgaon, Delhi, Banglore 
but  has  now  entered  even  the  home  of  Parsi  cooking  - 
Bombay itself. The Restaurant revival is only one part of 
the commercialization of Parsi food.  

Parsis  were  one  of  the  earliest  communities  to  use 
food, not only as a place for philanthropy and women’s 
economic  growth,  but  also  for  commercial  catering.  In 
Bombay  several  dozen  caterers  are  keenly  sought  and  a 
joke in Parsi circles is that the first question on receiving 
a Navjote or Wedding invitation is the question ‘Who is 
going to be the caterer’. In a tiny community these caterers 
are busy during the season September to March and each 
one has adapted to new circumstances by enlarging their 
repertoire of dishes or adding cocktails, serving Coca Cola 

rather than Dukes’ raspberry and grape drink and other 
new innovations. It is interesting that the market is now 
driving Parsi food back to its roots. Several famous Chefs 
are touring Parsi Gujarat and the Deccan to unearth hand 
written recipes and keep one step ahead of the competition.

willing to change and adjust to new circumstances across 
history and geography. Despite this, it is obvious that Parsi 
cuisine is an important marker of ethnic identity. 

Today,  across  the  cities  in  USA  and  Canada,  FEZANA- 
The  Federation  of  Zoroastrian  Anjumans  of  America, 
runs cookery competitions and the more authentic food, 
the  better.  Thus,  Parsi  food  now  spans  the  world  from 
Australia to Alaska and this tiny community celebrates its 
culture with others in the most ancient form of fellowship 
– that of breaking bread together.

Bhicoo  Manekshaw’s 
the  community’s  best-known 
culinary expert, personified within her work and writings 
the varying influences that has created Parsi cuisine. 

While she has received her training in continental cookery, 
she  has  also  done  intensive  research  on  the  history  and 
development of Parsi cuisine by traveling to the heartland 
of  Gujarat  where  a  substantial  majority  of  families  who 
maintain  the  old  traditions  of  Parsi  cooking  reside.  Her 
book,  The  Essential  of  Parsi  Cookery,  (Penguin  Books, 
India, 1996) is a treasure house of recipes and customs that 
define the Parsi way of life. 

Bhicoo  was  brought  up  in  a  traditional  Parsi  home  in 
Bombay, where all customs and traditions were observed 
and  celebrated.  Bhicoo  relates  how  Goan  food  has  been 
incorporated into Parsi cuisine. 

“After coming home from the market, each day, our Goan 
cook  would,  prepare  Goa  curry.  It  would  be  ready  by 
11 am, so that whenever any servant had any time they 
would  go  to  the  kitchen  and  help  themselves  to  it.  This 
Goa curry became a part and parcel of many Parsi homes, 
because children like me were practicably brought up on 
it by our ayahs”.

Many  years 
later, 
when 
Bhicoo’s 
husband, 
Air 
Vice  Marshal  J.  F. 
Manekshaw 
was 
in  London, 
posted 
she 
to 
develop  her  love  of 
food. Bhicoo wanted 
to  do  the  advance 
certificate 
the 
famous Cordon Bleu 
School in London.

of 

Bhicoo Manekshaw 

in a traditional Parsi Gara

She  was  told  that 
there was no vacancy 
for  a  year  as  they 
took only ten pupils 
at a time in that Course. Bhicoo asked the Principal if she 
would  just  go  through  the  manuscript  of  her  first  book, 
“Traditional Recipes of India”, which she had just finished 
writing, as she was not sure if it was worth publishing. 

After going through the script, the Principal told her that 
she  should  publish  it  and  asked  her  to  give  a  cookery 
demonstration.  Parsi  cuisine  came  to  the  fore.  Bhicoo 
gave a demonstration of papata ma murghi (chicken with 
potatoes) and kera pur enda (eggs on bananas). She was 
accepted on the course as the eleventh pupil. 

As  Advisor  to  the  India  International  Centre,  Bhicoo 
prepared meals for the highest in the land. Indira Gandhi, 
with  her  Parsi  connections  loved  this  food  as  did  many 
of  the  VVIPs  whom  Bhicoo  served,  showcasing  Indian 
diversity.

Rajasthani Cuisine

Gayatri Singh

Along with its monuments, sculptures and other tangible 
artefacts  of  a  rich  civilization,  ancient  India  developed 
an amazing variety of incomparable cooking techniques.  
Some of the most fascinating originated from the various 
princely states in the area that is today called Rajasthan. 

The Maharajas of these states prided themselves on their 
fine master cooks, their unique foods, their food advisors 
(who  were  considered  to  be  doctors),  and  their  intricate 
methods of cooking.  Prized recipes were closely guarded 
secrets.    The  refined  and  esoteric  recipes  of  the  royal 
courts, however, all grew from a vast store of knowledge 
developed over centuries throughout the region. 

Our  ancient  cooks  operated  under  the  strictures  of  a 
highly sophisticated culinary science.  And it was indeed a 
science.  The basic rules were that similar added to similar 
increases,  while  similar  added  to  its  opposite  reduces. 
Keeping this in mind, six primary tastes were identified: 
sweet,  sour,  salty,  bitter,  pungent,  and  astringent.  Foods 
were further identified by their effect on the body, either 
as heat producing or as cooling. 

Sweets, milk or fruit based recipes, for instance, increase 
mucus  content  and  have  a  cooling  action.  On  the  other 
hand,  ginger,  garlic,  black  pepper  and  chilies  are  heat 
producing. As the summer approached, the food advisors 
would warn against foods that were unwise to consume. 
At all times, they would instruct that some foods would 
be beneficial if eaten during the day, but unwise to take 
(and not digestible) after sunset; indeed, possibly poison 
at  night.  The  rules  were  many  and  precise.  Today  they 
have been confirmed by modern medical science but our 

ancestors knew them long before Google appeared on the 
scene.  

Rich foods predominated in the winter. Breads soaked in 
butter  melted  in  the  mouth  and  were  eaten  after  dainty 
portions of meat, served with raw onions, green chilies and 
lemon. Vegetables were scarce; those that were available 
were  all  grown  locally  and  dried  for  use  throughout 
the  year.  Perhaps  because  of  the  difficulty  of  growing 
vegetables in the desert, meats were plentiful and cooked 
in numerous ways.   

The methods of cooking in ancient Rajasthan were creative, 
adapted to both the climate and the available resources.  
The most common were: 

Clay  Baking.    Foods  were  marinated  and  mixed,  then 
wrapped in muslin cloth, clad with clay and baked in coal. 

Stone Roasting - A flat slab of stone was placed on blazing 
coal. Once hot, it would work as a grill and food placed 
upon it would be roasted. 

Pit  Cooking  -  A  pit  was  dug,  layered  with  wood  and 
blazing coal. Food was placed in the pit and then covered 
with  coal,  leaving  a  “breathing  pipe.”  At  times  grain 
was kneaded into dough and baked in the pit. Food was 
sometimes wrapped in leaves of a particular tree -- such as 
flame of the forest -- or rice was packed in lotus leaves and 
cooked on the top layer of coal. 

Dum  (steaming)  -  Food  would  be  sealed  with  dough; 
ensuring  that  moisture  could  not  escape  and  that  both 
flavour and aroma would be trapped within. 

125

Traditional Cuisines of IndiaTraditional Cuisines of IndiaBhagar- was a method of enhancing boiled food. Spice was 
added to a few spoons of heated ghee, taking advantage 
of  the  ability  of  ghee  (or  oil)  to  extract  both  aroma  and 
flavour from the spices and herbs. 

Dhungar (smoking) - A few drops of ghee were drizzled 
over a flaming coal and then placed in the dish containing 
the food, which was then tightly covered. The smoke could 
not escape and would permeate the entire dish. 

The origins of the techniques are buried in antiquity, but 
they still survive throughout Rajasthan. In a desert village, 
a clay pot will be broken and a piece of the pottery thrust 
down  into  the  simmering  food,  which  is  then  tightly 
covered. The entire dish will be permeated by a delicate 
smokiness from the piece of clay. 

At  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum,  a  guest  of  the  royal 
family may be served hare that has been encased in pastry 
and cooked in a pit below ground, before being taken out 
and presented as a great delicacy. 

From  these  simple  yet  subtle  techniques,  creativity 
soared into truly fantastic realms. A recipe of which my 
grandmother was especially proud, involved an individual 
baingan (aubergine) plant. 

Apart  from  the  vegetables  hanging  on  the  branches  the 
rest of the plant was covered in clay, each baingan slit and 
stuffed with spices, then roasted while still on the branch. 
Before serving, the clay was washed and guests presented 
with a living plant from, which they could pluck and eat a 
perfectly cooked jewel of a vegetable.

These  things  are  a  strong  and  important  part  of  our 
heritage and should be documented and preserved so that 
we do not lose them.

THE RECIPES

RICE OR CHOWL

Rice is consumed by most European families at breakfast, tiffin, and dinner. It is eaten at breakfast
with fried meat, fish, omelet, country captain, or some other curried dish, and, being invariably
followed by toast and eggs, jams, fruit, &c., one coonkee, which contains about as much as an
ordinary   breakfast-cup,  or   say   half   a   pound,   will  always  be   ample   for   four   tolerably   hearty
consumers. There are two sizes of coonkees, large and small: reference is here made to the small
coonkee, well filled. The quantity, however, of raw rice for a party of four should not exceed half a
pound.

The rice at dinner is usually preceded by soup, fish, roast, and made dishes.

The best or generally approved qualities of rice for table use are known as the bhaktoolsee, the
banafool, the bassmuttee, and cheeneesuckur. In purchasing these, or indeed any other approved
quality, care must be taken to avoid new rice and what is called urruah, which latter has been put
through some process of boiling, or damped, and then dried. Both are considered unwholesome for
general daily consumption, and few Indians will use them.

Good rice when rubbed in the palm of the hand, and cleared of dust, will appear of a bright and
nearly transparent yellowish colour; whereas the urruah will be found of a dull whitish hue, and the
grain streaked and speckled with white powder, which crumbles on the application of a needle's
point.

The price of rice, like other commodities, varies according to its plenty or scarcity in the market.
After the cyclone of October, 1864, and again of November, 1867, the price of the bhaktoolsee and
the banafool, which are fine, large, stout-grain rice, without being coarse, ruled at from eight to nine
seers per rupee, and the bassmuttee and the cheeneesuckur at from seven to eight seers per rupee.
The rice used by the poorest classes of the native population is of a very coarse description and
incredibly cheap: within six weeks after the cyclone of November, 1867, it was readily procurable at
twenty-five to thirty seers per rupee.

Rice is used in a variety of forms: it is boiled, made into kitcheeree, pellow, puddings, blanc mange,
cakes, bread, &c.

The bhaktoolsee, the banafool, and other stout-grain rice are the best adapted for boiling. Boiled rice
is called bhath.

The bassmuttee, cheeneesuckur, and all small and fine-grain rice are selected for kitcheeree, pellow,
and puddings for children's food, and for invalids.

The urruah is used in some houses in ignorance, but for the most part it is made into flour, and used
for blanc mange, cakes, &c. The flour is abundantly procurable in the Calcutta markets, and is
largely used by all native bakers in the making of bread.

Twenty-two to twenty-five seers of rice monthly, consuming it three times a day, entertainments
included, will be ample for a party of four, allowing occasionally for a rice pudding.

It is necessary to wash rice thoroughly in several waters before using it, and a colander is very useful
for draining away the water after washing the rice.

1.--Boiled Rice

Wash half a pound or a coonkeeful of rice, and put it to boil in a large quantity of water, over a brisk
fire. Immediately the rice begins to boil, the water will bubble up to the surface of the pot and
overflow, carrying away quantities of scum and impurities. The cover of the pot should now be kept
partially open, and the rice stirred to prevent an entire overflow of the water. On the subsiding of the
water or the bubbling, the fire should be reduced, until it is satisfactorily ascertained that the grains
of rice, without being pappy, are quite soft, when the pot should be removed from the fire and a
quart of cold water be added. All the liquid, which is "conjee," should then be drained, and the pot
replaced over a gentle charcoal heat, to allow all moisture to evaporate, assisting the process by
occasionally shaking the pot, or stirring its contents gently with a wooden spoon. Time to boil: half
an hour.

The coonkee of rice when properly boiled will fill a good-sized curry or vegetable dish. The rice will
be found quite soft, and yet every grain perfectly separate. Rice should never be cooked into a pap,
excepting it is required for very young children; and leaving the grains hard or uncooked should be
equally avoided.

A small pinch of pounded alum or fitkerree is used by some cooks with advantage to improve the
whiteness of boiled rice.

2.--Rice Conjee

The water in which rice is boiled should never be thrown away: it is nutritious and fattening for all
cattle, horses included, and may be given daily to milch cows and goats with great advantage.

3.--Rice Kheer

This is occasionally served upon the breakfast-table as a treat, but few Europeans care for it. It is
made   as   follows:--Thoroughly   boil   one   coonkee   or   half   a   pound   of   the   bassmuttee   or   the
cheeneesuckur rice, then drain the water away, add two cups of pure cow's milk, and put over a
slow fire. As the rice begins to absorb the milk, two or three small sticks of cinnamon are put in,
with one tablespoonful and a half to two tablespoonfuls of fine-quality white sugar. On the milk
being entirely absorbed, the kheer is either turned out upon a dish and eaten hot, or put into a
buttered mould, served up in shape, and eaten cold.

Kheer is sometimes cooked or boiled in milk only, but the foregoing recipe is supposed to be that
more generally approved.

4.--Pish-Pash

Pick and wash in several waters a coonkee or half a pound of the bassmuttee or other fine-grain
rice; add to it, cleaned and cut up, a chicken, some sliced ginger, sliced onions, a few bay-leaves,
some peppercorns, a few hotspice, a dessertspoonful of salt, one chittack or two ounces of butter,
and water sufficient to cover the whole. Simmer over a slow fire until the chicken becomes perfectly
tender and the rice quite pappy. Serve up hot. This is considered a most excellent and nutritious
meal for invalids.

KITCHEEREES

These are occasionally substituted for boiled rice at breakfast, and are eaten with fried fish, omelets,
croquets, jhal frezee, &c. They are prepared as follows:--

5.--Bhoonee Kitcheeree

Take rather more than three-quarters of a coonkee of bassmuttee or cheeneesuckur and half a
coonkee of dal; or, if preferred, take the rice and dal in equal parts.

Take twelve large curry onions and cut them up lengthways into fine slices. Warm up two chittacks
or four ounces of ghee (but before doing so be careful to warm the pot), and, while bubbling, throw
in the sliced onions, removing them immediately they become of a bright brown colour. Set the fried
onions aside, and throw in the dal and rice (having previously allowed all the water in which they
were washed to drain through a colander). Fry until the dal and rice have absorbed all the ghee; then
add a few slices of green ginger, some peppercorns, salt to taste (say one dessertspoonful), a few
cloves, three or four cardamoms, half a dozen bay-leaves, and as many small sticks of cinnamon.
Mix well together; add as much water only as will entirely cover over the whole of the rice and dal,
put a good-fitting cover on, and set over a slow fire, reducing the same from time to time as the
water is being absorbed. Care must be taken not to allow the kitcheeree to burn, which may be
prevented by occasionally shaking the pot, or stirring its contents with a wooden spoon.

Serve up quite hot, strewing over it the fried onions, which serve both as a relish and garnish of the
dish.

6.--Bhoonee Kitcheeree of the Mussoor or Red Dal is made according to recipe No. 5.

7.--Bhoonee Kitcheeree of the Moong or Small-grain Yellow Dal is made according to recipe

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

No. 5.

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

8.--Bhoonee Kitcheeree of the Gram or Chunna Dal

The chunna or gram dal makes a very nice kitcheeree; but, as it is rather hard, it should be boiled or
soaked in cold water for an hour or so before frying it with the raw rice.

9.--Bhoonee Kitcheeree of Green Peas

Kitcheeree made of green peas grown of English seeds is a rarity. Large peas should be picked out
and shelled; they should not be fried with the  rice, but added to it when nearly cooked. The
instructions given in recipe No. 5 are to be observed in all other respects.

10.--Jurrud or Yellow-tinted Kitcheeree

Jurrud or yellow-tinted kitcheeree is nothing more than one of the above kitcheerees, to which is
added, at the time of frying the rice and dal, either a small quantity of saffron or turmeric, according
to the colour desired to be imparted. Such introduction in no way affects the flavour, nor does it
render the appearance of the dish more attractive, but serves admirably as a variety for a large
breakfast-table.

11.--Geela Kitcheeree

This is usually made of moong dal with less than one-fourth the quantity of ghee allowed for the
bhoonee, or with no ghee at all, and little or no condiments are used, excepting a small quantity of
finely-sliced green ginger, a few peppercorns, one or two bay-leaves, and salt to taste. It is supposed
to be better adapted than bhoonee kitcheeree for children and invalids.

By bhoonee is meant crisp, and geela signifies soft.

PELLOW OR POOLOO

Pellows are purely Hindoostanee dishes. There are several kinds of pellow, but some of them are so
entirely of an Asiatic character and taste that no European will ever be persuaded to partake of
them. It is therefore considered useless to offer instructions how to prepare such as the ukhnee
pellow, in which are introduced cream, milk, butter-milk, garlic, and lime-juice; or the sweet pellow,

16 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

in which almonds and raisins are introduced, in addition to sugar, &c.

The following are the pellows in general use:--

12.--Chicken Pellow

Take a good-sized chicken; clean, truss, and boil it with one pound of beef in two cupfuls of clean
water, seasoning it with onions, ginger, and salt. When sufficiently cooked, but yet quite firm,
remove the chicken, and set it and the gravy aside. Cut up twelve onions lengthways into fine slices.
Warm your pot; then melt in it two chittacks or four ounces of ghee, and, as it bubbles, throw in the
sliced onions and fry to a light brown; remove and set aside. Then put in half a pound, or a coonkee,
or the best bassmuttee or cheeneesuckur, having drained away all the water in which it was washed,
and fry. On the rice absorbing the ghee, throw in a few cloves, four or five cardamoms, half a dozen
small sticks of cinnamon, some peppercorns, a blade or two of mace, and one dessertspoonful of
salt. Mix up the whole, and pour over it the gravy in which the chicken and beef were boiled, or as
much of it only as will entirely cover the rice; close the pot immediately with a close-fitting cover,
and set on a slow fire. As the gravy continues to decrease or to be absorbed, so keep reducing the
fire, shaking up the pot occasionally, or stirring its contents, to prevent the pellow from burning.
Brown the boiled chicken in a pan with ghee or butter, and serve up as follows:--

Place the chicken, either whole or cut up, on the centre of a dish, covering it with the pellow; strew
over it the fried onions, garnishing it besides with two hard-boiled eggs, cut into halves, or in some
device, and with half a dozen bits of finely-sliced and fried bacon, to suit the taste of those who like
the latter.

13.--Beef, Mutton, or Kid Pellow

Take two pounds of beef, and cut up as for a curry, or take a small but good leg of mutton, or two
legs of a kid, rejecting the loin.

Make a good, strong gravy with seasoning of sliced onions, ginger, and salt, with water, which when
cooked down will be reduced to about sufficient only to cover the rice. Then proceed to make the
pellow in all respects as directed in the foregoing recipe. The beef is not further used for the table,
but treat the legs of the kid, or the mutton, the same as the chicken, and serve up with fried onions,
hard-boiled eggs, and fried bacon, like the chicken pellow.

14.--Prawn Pellow

Instead of a chicken, provide yourself with eight or ten good-sized "bagda prawns," and a good hard
cocoanut. After frying and setting aside the sliced onions, as directed above, the rice is to be fried,
but, instead of using chicken or any other meat broth, cook it in the milk of the cocoanut (vide
recipe No. 54), observing in all particulars the instructions given for the chicken pellow, recipe No.
12, and serve up as follows:--Dish up the pellow, strew over it the fried onions, and garnish with the
prawns finely boiled, and two hard-boiled eggs cut in halves or in some other device.

The cocoanut milk will impart a sweetish flavour to the pellow, but it is not disagreeable; and its
sweetness may be subdued, if required, by reducing the strength of the cocoanut milk.

15.--Lobster or Fish Pellow

Take out the centre bones or one or two hilsa or beckty fishes, which are procurable fresh and good
in the market, and eight or ten large long-legged lobsters with the roe or coral; thoroughly wash in
several waters with salt, and boil with plenty of seasoning of onions, sliced ginger, peppercorns, a
dozen bay-leaves, a tablespoonful of unroasted dhuniah or coriander seed, and salt, with water
sufficient  to give  the  required  quantity  of  gravy. When ready, remove  and shell the  lobsters,
reserving the roe or red coral in the heads, which bruise down with a little unroasted coriander seed,
and mix with the fish gravy. Make the pellow in all other respects the same as prawn pellow, using
the gravy of the fish instead of cocoanut or other gravy, and garnish with the lobsters, &c.

CURRIES

A curry-stone and muller, or what the natives call seal our lurriah, are necessary for the preparation
of condiments for daily use. The condiments should be carefully, and each kind separately, ground
down to a nice paste with a little water.

Condiments prepared with water will not keep good any number of days; if required for a journey,
therefore, or as presents for friends at home, good sweet oil and the best English vinegar should be
substituted for the water. For the preparation of condiments for this purpose see recipe No. 65.

The first cost of a curry-stone and muller of large size will not exceed one rupee, but they will
require re-cutting every three or four months, at a cost not exceeding one anna each re-setting.

The following is a list of curry condiments and hotspice in almost daily use:--
Curry onions, or carree ka piaj, price from 3 to 8 pice per seer.
Turmeric, or huldee   "     3 to 5 annas   "
Garlic, or lussoon    "     2 to 3 annas   "
Green ginger, or uddruck  "     2 to 4 annas   "
Dry chilies, or sooka mirritch  "     3 to 5 annas   "
Coriander-seed, or dhunnia"     3 to 4 annas   "
Cumin-seed, or jeerah "     5 to 6 annas   "
Peppercorns, or gool mirritch   "     5 to 6 annas   "
Bay-leaves, or tage paththa     "     2 to 3 annas   "
Lemon-grass, or uggheaghass     "     3 to 6 pice for a
bundle of 16 to 20 blades of grass.
Poppy-seed, or post ka danna    "     3 to 4 annas per seer.
Onion-seed, or cullinga   "     5 to 8 annas   "
Stick cinnamon, or dalcheenee  -+
Cardamoms, or elachee     |   Mixed; prices range from Rs.
Cloves, or loung+-  3-14 to 4 per seer.
Nutmeg, or jyephall |
Mace, or jowttree  -+

However high prices may range, one rupee-worth of mixed condiments, including hotspice, will
suffice for a month's consumption for a party of from four to six adults, allowing for three curries
per day, cutlets and made dishes included.

GRAVY CURRIES

18 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

The following directions for an every-day gravy chicken curry will apply equally to all ordinary
meat gravy curries:--

16.--Chicken Curry

Take one chittack or two ounces of ghee, two breakfast-cupfuls of water, one teaspoonful and a half
of salt, four teaspoonfuls of ground onions, one teaspoonful each of ground turmeric and chilies, half
a teaspoonful of ground ginger, and a quarter of a teaspoonful of ground garlic.

To suit the taste of those who like it, half a teaspoonful of ground coriander-seed may be added,
which should be roasted before being ground. Observe the following directions for cooking:--

Take the usual full-sized curry chicken, the price of which has latterly ranged from three to four
annas, and divide  it  into sixteen  or   eighteen  pieces. Warm the   pot,  melt  in  it  the   ghee,  and
immediately it begins to bubble throw in all the ground condiments, stirring until quite brown; then
put in the cut-up chicken and the salt, and stir up to a good light-brown colour; then add the water,
and allow the whole to simmer over a slow fire until the chicken is quite tender, and the liquid
reduced to about half its original quantity. The operation of cooking or simmering will take from a
half to three-quarters of an hour.

17.--Kid Curry

Take a hind-quarter or a fore-quarter of kid, which may be obtained at from three to four annas the
quarter; cut it up into sixteen or eighteen pieces; take condiments in the proportion given in recipe
No. 16, and cook it in every particular the same as the chicken curry, allowing it to simmer three-
quarters of an hour.

18.--Veal Curry

A small shoulder of veal, the price of which ranges from three to four annas, may be selected; cut
off from it sixteen or eighteen one-inch square pieces of the best part of the meat, and curry it in
every particular the same as a chicken, only allowing it to simmer half to three-quarters of an hour.

19.--Mutton Curry

Obtain a small shoulder at from five to six annas; cut it up into sixteen or eighteen one-inch square
pieces, rejecting all the bones; curry it the same as a chicken, allowing it to simmer for half an hour
longer, or until the meat is tender.

N.B.--The bones of the veal and mutton, referred to in this and the foregoing recipe, may be turned
to account for stock or gravy for some made dish.

20.--Beef Curry

Two pounds of well-selected meat will cost from three to four annas; cut it up into one-inch square
pieces, rejecting all the scraggy parts; cook it in every respect according to the instructions given in
recipe No. 16 for cooking a gravy chicken curry, only allowing it to simmer for a much longer time
than any other curry, or until the beef becomes tender.

21.--Green Duck Curry

The price of a young tender duck may be quoted at from four to five annas. Cut it up exactly as you
would a chicken, and curry it in the same manner, allowing it to simmer for an hour and a half. It is
desirable to introduce half a teaspoonful each of coriander and cumin seeds in this curry.

22.--Young Pigeon Curry

Take four young pigeons; cut each into four pieces, making in all sixteen pieces. The price of young
pigeons ranges from five to six annas the pair. The instructions given for the cooking of a gravy
chicken curry apply equally to a pigeon curry.

DOOPIAJAS

The literal translation of doopiaja is "two onions," and the term probably is correctly applicable, as
it will be noticed, in the recipes for preparing the doopiaja curries, that besides the full quantity of
ground onions, it is necessary to put in about an equal quantity of fried onions, thereby doubling the
quantity of onions.

Doopiajas are more piquant curries; they are cooked with more ghee and less water. The following
condiments, &c., are considered ample for a really good doopiaja of chicken or of any meat:--

One chittack and a half or three ounces of ghee, one breakfast-cupful of water, one teaspoonful and
a half of salt, four teaspoonfuls of ground onions, one teaspoonful each of ground turmeric and
chilies, half a teaspoonful of ground ginger, a quarter of a teaspoonful of ground garlic, twelve
onions cut lengthways, each into six or eight slices, and half a teaspoonful of ground coriander-seed
if it be liked.

23.--Chicken Doopiaja

Take a full-sized curry chicken and divide it into sixteen or eighteen pieces. Melt the ghee in a warm
or heated pot, fry brown the sliced onions and set aside; then fry the ground condiments, stirring the
whole; when brown, add the cut-up chicken with the salt, and fry to a rich brown. Chop the fried
onions and put into the pot with one cup of water, and allow to simmer over a slow fire for about
one hour, when the chicken will be perfectly tender, and the liquid reduced to a thick consistency,
and to half its original quantity.

24.--Kid Doopiaja

Is made in all respects as a chicken doopiaja, the kid to be cut up in the usual manner. The hind
quarter is preferable to the fore quarter.

25.--Veal Doopiaja

Take only the meat from a shoulder, cut it up into squares, and allow it to simmer for half an hour
longer than the chicken doopiaja.

26.--Mutton Doopiaja

The flesh part of a shoulder is cut up into squares and doopiajed exactly as a chicken, allowing it to
simmer over a slow fire for half an hour longer.

27.--Beef Doopiaja

Cut two pounds of beef into one-inch square pieces, and follow all the instructions given in recipe
No. 23, only allowing it to simmer for a much longer time over a slow fire, until the beef is perfectly
tender.

28.--Duck Doopiaja

Divide as you would a chicken, and cook the duck in the same manner, allowing it to simmer a little
longer than the chicken doopiaja. Half a teaspoonful each of ground coriander and cumin seed
should be mixed with the condiments.

29.--Doopiaja of Pigeons

Take four pigeons, cut each into four pieces, and proceed in every particular the same as for a
chicken doopiaja.

30.--Cold Boiled Pork Doopiaja

Cut from the remains of cold boiled pork sixteen one-inch square pieces, and doopiaje it in the way

20 of 98

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

directed for a chicken. The time required to simmer will not exceed that allowed for the chicken
doopiaja.

31.--Udder Doopiaja

Take two pounds of udder; before cutting it into squares, it should be parboiled, and then made into
doopiaja, allowing it to simmer over a slow fire for about two hours.

32.--Udder and Beef Doopiaja

Take one pound each of udder and beef; parboil the udder, and then cut it up with the beef into
one-inch square pieces, and doopiaje it, allowing it to simmer for about two hours.

It is necessary to impress on the amateur artist the importance of paying particular attention to the
firing: a brisk fire will dry up the ghee and the water before the curry is half cooked, and necessitate
the addition of more water, which will in every instance spoil the doopiaja, although the addition of
a little water, if such be necessary when the curry is nearly cooked, will do it no harm. In every
instance where ghee butter, &c., is to be melted, it is desirable first to warm the pot.

FORCEMEAT BALL CURRIES, OR COFTA-KA-CARREE

Beef, mutton, chicken, fish, crabs, and prawns are usually taken for making these curries. The
ingredients for two pounds of meat or fish are as follow:--Lard, ghee, or mustard oil, three to four
ounces; water or stock, five to six ounces; ground onions, one tablespoonful or one ounce; ground
chilies, a quarter of a tablespoonful, ground turmeric, a quarter of a tablespoonful; ground green
ginger, half a teaspoonful; ground peppercorns, half a teaspoonful; ground garlic, a quarter of a
teaspoonful; garden herbs, finely chopped, one dessertspoonful; salt, one dessertspoonful; finely-
grated bread-crumbs, three tablespoonfuls; one egg.

N.B.--In the fish, crab, and prawn coftas the ginger must be omitted.

33.--Beef Forcemeat Ball Curry

Get rather more than two pounds of good fat beef; wash it thoroughly, and cut it into pieces,
rejecting all veins and scraggy portions; put about two pounds of it into a mortar and pound it fine,
removing all fibres, veins, &c., and if it be desired put up a broth of all the rejections. Mix with the
pounded beef a teaspoonful of salt, pepper, and garden herbs, and two tablespoonfuls of bread-
crumbs; add a little of the broth, or in its absence some milk; mix the whole well together; beat up
the yolk and white of the egg, add it to the mixture, and make into balls about the size of large
walnuts; roll them in bread-crumbs. After heating the pot, melt the lard or ghee, and fry brown the
ground ingredients, sprinkling a tablespoonful of cold water over them; then add the coftas or balls
with salt to taste, and fry or brown them; after which pour into the pot either a cup of broth or of
water, and allow to simmer for about two hours.

N.B.--Some cooks add to the beef cofta curries ground hot spices, which are fried with the curry
condiments, and are suited to most tastes.

34.--Chicken Forcemeat Ball Curry

Procure a good fat chicken and a quarter of a pound of beef suet; put the suet into a mortar with all
the fleshy parts of the chicken, and pound to a pulp; make a stock of gravy of the bones; mix with
the pounded meat all the several ingredients named in the foregoing recipe, with the addition of an
egg well beaten up; make into balls, roll in bread-crumbs, and curry as directed above.

N.B.--The chicken cofta curry may also be made without any suet; the general practice is to get
chickens rather larger than those usually selected for ordinary curries.

35.--Mutton Forcemeat Ball Curry

21 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

Take the best parts of a leg or shoulder of mutton; cut them up, wash, and pound well down; make a
gravy of the bones and rejections; mix with the pounded mutton all the ingredients mentioned in the
recipe for making beef balls, and cook exactly as the beef cofta curry.

36.--Ball Curry of Liver and Udder

Get one pound each of liver and udder; thoroughly wash and parboil them, then cut them into
pieces, put into a mortar, and pound them to a pulp; mix with pepper, salt, herbs, bread-crumbs, and
an egg; make into balls, and curry them in the same manner as any of the foregoing forcemeat ball
curries.

37.--Prawn Cofta Curry

Get thirty to forty of the best prawns, and remove the heads and shells; wash the prawns well with
salt and water, then pound them to a pulp; mix with it all the ingredients as directed for the beef
cofta; make into balls, roll them in bread-crumbs, and set aside. After washing the heads, remove
the shells, and bruise the contents with a dessertspoonful of unroasted coriander-seed; take all the
juice, and fry it with the ground condiments; then put in the balls, brown them, add salt to taste, a
cup of water, and simmer until they are cooked.

N.B.--Good mustard oil is preferable to using lard or ghee, and the ginger must be omitted; but the
addition of a few bay-leaves and blades of lemon-grass would be an improvement. It is not usual to
dish up the lemon-grass.

38.--Lobster Cofta Curry

According to their size, take eight or ten lobsters; clean them thoroughly; remove the heads and
shells; pull the flesh to pieces and pound to a pulp; add to it some of the red coral from the head,
then mix into it the bread-crumbs, salt, pepper, herbs, and an egg well beaten up, and make into
balls. The  remains of the  heads and the contents of the  long legs bruise down with unroasted
coriander-seed; omitting the ginger, and cook the balls in the same way as the prawn balls, with the
addition of bay-leaves and a few blades of lemon-grass. Lemon-grass is not served up.

39.--Crab Cofta Curry

Select ten or twelve gheewalla kakakahs, or crabs full of the red coral, wash them thoroughly, then
boil them; remove all the meat and coral out of the shells, pound to a pulp, and, after mixing all the
ingredients and fixing them with an egg well beaten up, make into balls, and cook them in all
respects according to the directions for lobster cofta curry. Time to simmer: say half an hour.

40.--Fish Cofta Curry

Cold boiled or fried fish is the best adapted for making coftas; it is not necessary to give other
instructions than those already given at length in the foregoing recipes, excepting that mustard oil is
the best adapted for fresh fish curries.

N.B.--The remains of hermetically-sealed fish, such as salmon and mackerel, removed from dinner,
are well adapted for making cofta curries.

Under-done roast meats, such as beef, mutton, veal, and fowl, will make excellent cofta curries.

COUNTRY CAPTAIN

The country captain is usually made of chicken, and occasionally of kid and veal. Cold meats and
curries are also sometimes converted into this dish, the condiments for which are as follow:--Two
chittacks or four ounces of ghee, half a teaspoonful of ground chilies, one teaspoonful of salt, a
quarter of a teaspoonful of ground turmeric, and twenty onions, cut up lengthways into fine slices.

41.--Chicken Country Captain

22 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

Cut up in the usual way an ordinary curry chicken. Warm the ghee and fry the sliced onions, which
when brown set aside; fry the ground turmeric and chilies, then throw in the chicken and salt, and
continue to fry, stirring the whole, until the chicken is tender. Serve it up, strewing over it the fried
onions.

42.--Kid Country Captain

Before cutting up the kid, a fore-quarter, let it be partially broiled or roasted, and then make it into
country captain in accordance with the above directions; or, instead of partially roasting the kid, add
half a cup of water to assist the meat to dissolve.

43.--Veal Country Captain

Partially broil or roast a shoulder of veal before cutting it up; or make the country captain as
directed in recipe No. 42, by adding half a cup of water instead of partially broiling the meat.

44.--Jhal Frezee

Cut up into small squares, of less than an inch, either cold mutton, beef, or veal, rejecting the bones;
add a large quantity of sliced onions, some chilies cut up, and a teaspoonful of salt. Warm a chittack,
or two ounces of ghee, and throw it into the meat, onions, chilies, and salt, and allow to simmer, or
fry, stirring the whole while, until the onions are quite tender.

HINDOOSTANEE CURRIES

45.--Seik Kawab

Is usually eaten with chappatee or hand-bread, and only occasionally with rice, and contains the
following condiments:--Two tablespoonfuls of mustard oil, four teaspoonfuls of ground onions, one
teaspoonful of ground chilies, half a teaspoonful of ground ginger, a quarter of a teaspoonful of
ground garlic, one teaspoonful of ground turmeric, one teaspoonful and a half of salt, a cup of thick
tyre or dhye, half a teaspoonful of ground coriander-seed, the juice of one large lemon, and a little
ghee.

Take two pounds of beef, mutton, or veal; remove the bones, and chop the meat slightly, without
mincing or cutting through it; mix well together all the ground condiments, including the oil, tyre,
and lemon-juice, in which steep the  chopped meat, turning it over occasionally to absorb the
mixture. After a while cut up the meat into squares of equal size, say two inches, and continue to
keep them in the mixture for fully one hour; then pass the squares of meat either on a silver, plated,
or other metal skewer, and roast or broil over a slow charcoal fire, basting the whole time with ghee,
to allow the kawab to become of a rich brown colour, without burning or being singed in the basting.
Remove from the skewer, and serve hot.

46.--Tick-keeah Kawab

Take two pounds of fat beef, wash it, cut it into small pieces, and pound it to a pulp, remove all
fibres, &c., and then add to it one teaspoonful of ground onion, a quarter of a teaspoonful of ground
turmeric, one-eighth of a teaspoonful of ground garlic, a quarter of a teaspoonful of ground chilies,
half a  teaspoonful of ground peppercorns, a  quarter of a  teaspoonful of ground ginger, half a
teaspoonful of ground hot spices, and one tablespoonful of tyre or dhye.

Mix the whole well together, add salt to your taste, and the yolk and white of an egg well beaten up;
form into balls of equal sizes; flatten them, pass them on iron or plated skewers about eighteen
inches long, rub them well over with ghee, wrap them in plantain-leaf, and roast or broil them over a
charcoal  fire.   Serve   them  up   hot,   removed   from  the   skewers.   These   are   usually   eaten   with
chappatee.

HUSSANEE CURRIES, OR CURRIES ON STICK

23 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

The ingredients and condiments necessary for the curries on stick are as follow:--One chittack and a
half of ghee, one teaspoonful and a half of salt, four teaspoonfuls of ground onions, one teaspoonful
of turmeric, half a teaspoonful of ginger, half a cupful of water, a quarter of a teaspoonful of ground
garlic, one teaspoonful of chilies, half a cupful of tyre or dhye, some finely-sliced ginger, and as
many small curry onions cut into half as may be required. Six silver pins five inches long, or, in the
absence of these, six bamboo pins, are required.

47.--Hussanee Beef Curry

Cut up two pounds of beef into small squares not exceeding one inch, and pass them on the silver or
bamboo pins alternately with half an onion and a slice of ginger. Half a dozen sticks with be ample
for four hearty consumers.

Warm the ghee and brown the ground condiments; then put in the sticks of meat, and brown, stirring
the whole; after this add the tyre and a little water, and allow to simmer over a slow fire for nearly
two hours, when the curry will be ready. Serve up on a curry-dish without removing the sticks.

48.--Hussanee Mutton Curry

Remove the meat from a shoulder of mutton, and cut it into small squares; the same instructions will
apply to the preparation of mutton curry on stick as those given for beef curry on stick. Time to
simmer: half an hour.

49.--Hussanee Veal Curry

Cut squares enough from a shoulder of veal, and observe the instructions given in the foregoing
recipe. Time to simmer: one hour.

50.--Hussanee Curry of Udder and Liver

The udder and liver should be parboiled before being cut up for passing on the sticks; but in all other
respects the instructions given for the beaf and mutton curries on stick will apply to the udder and
liver curry on stick. Time to simmer: fully one hour and a half.

KURMA OR QUOREMA CURRY

This, without exception, is one of the richest of Hindoostanee curries, but it is quite unsuited to
European taste, if made, according to the original recipe, of which the following is a copy:--

51.--Quorema Curry, Plain

Take  two pounds of mutton, one  pound of tyre  or dhye, two chittacks of garlic, one dam of
cardamoms, four chittacks of bruised almonds, four mashas of saffron, the juice of five lemons, one
pound of ghee, four chittacks of sliced onions, one dam of cloves, one chittack of pepper, four
chittacks of cream, and a quarter of a teaspoonful of ground garlic.

The following is the recipe of the quorema curry usually put on a gentleman's table:--Two chittacks
and a half or five ounces of ghee, one cup or eight ounces of good thick tyre, one teaspoonful of
ground chilies, four teaspoonfuls of ground onions, one teaspoonful of coriander-seed, six small
sticks of ground cinnamon, two or three blades of lemon-grass, one teaspoonful and a half of salt, a
half   teaspoonful  of   ground   ginger,   a   quarter   of   a   teaspoonful  of   ground   garlic,   eight   or   ten
peppercorns, four or five ground cloves, five or six ground cardamoms, two or three bay-leaves, a
quarter of a cup of water, the juice of one lemon, and twelve large onions cut lengthways into fine
slices.

Take two pounds of good fat mutton, and cut it up into pieces nearly one inch and a half square.
Warm the  ghee, fry in it the  sliced onions, and set aside; then fry all the ground condiments,
including the ground hot spices. When quite brown, throw in the mutton and salt, and allow the
whole to brown, after which add the tyre, the hot spices with peppercorns and bay-leaves, the

24 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

lemon-grass, the water, and the fried onions finely chopped; close the pot, and allow it to simmer
over a gentle coal fire for about an hour and a half or two hours, by which time the kurma will be
quite ready. The blades of lemon-grass are never dished up.

52.--Kid Quorema

Cut up a fore-quarter or a hind-quarter of a kid into eight or ten pieces, and cook it exactly as
directed in the foregoing recipe. This is rather preferred to mutton quorema.

53.--Fowl Quorema

Take a  young full-ground tender fowl; cut it up as for an ordinary curry, cook it with all the
condiments in the proportions given, and observe all the directions laid down in recipe No. 51.

N.B.--Most Europeans give the preference to the fowl quorema.

MALAY CURRIES

The condiments and other ingredients necessary are as follow:--One chittack or two ounces of ghee,
one teaspoonful and a half of salt, four teaspoonfuls of ground onions, one teaspoonful of ground
turmeric, one teaspoonful of ground chilies, half a teaspoonful of ground ginger, a quarter of a
teaspoonful of ground garlic, the milk of a large cocoanut, say two cups, two blades of lemon-grass,
three or four cloves, ground, three or four cardamoms, and as many small sticks of cinnamon,
ground.

The coriander and cumin seeds must on no account be put into malay curries, or the delicate flavour
of the cocoanut will be destroyed.

It will be necessary to provide what the natives call a narial-ka-khoornee, which, interpreted, means
"cocoanut scraper." It is a small circular flat piece of iron, about the size and thickness of a Spanish
dollar, the edges being notched. It is of rude construction, and fixed on a conveniently shaped
wooden frame, also of rude construction. The best of the kind may be procured for two annas.

54.--Cocoanut Milk

The nut is scraped or rasped with the aid of the "khoornee" into very fine particles; it is then put into
a deep vessel, and boiling water poured over it until the whole of the scraped cocoanut is covered.
After allowing it to steep for ten or fifteen minutes, it is carefully strained through a clean napkin
into another vessel or cup, the pulp is returned into the original vessel, and more boiling water is
poured over it. This operation of steeping in boiling water and straining is continued until you have
obtained the required quantity of the extracted milk of the cocoanut. The pulp is thrown away. If the
cocoanut be a small one, or its nut not hard and deep, it will be necessary to provide a second
cocoanut. Good cocoanuts are sold at an anna to an anna and a half a piece.

55.--Chicken Malay Gravy Curry with White Pumpkin or Cucumber

Take the usual full-sized curry chicken, and divide it as before directed; get either six cucumbers or
a quarter of a white pumpkin; remove the green skin and the part containing the seeds, then cut it up
into sixteen pieces of about two inches square, and steep in water.

Fry in the ghee all the ground condiments, including the ground hot spices; when brown, add the
cut-up chicken and salt; fry to a fine bright light brown; then put in the pumpkin, having previously
allowed all the water to drain away through a colander; pour in the two cups of cocoanut milk, the
lemon-grass, and hot spices, and allow the whole to simmer over a slow fire for about half an hour,
when the curry will be ready: the blade of lemon-grass is not dished up.

56.--Prawn Malay Gravy Curry with White Pumpkin or Cucumber

Select the bagda prawns (bagda chingree), whenever they are procurable, in preference to any other

25 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

description. The shell and head are of a dark colour in comparison with what are called jeel ka
chingree, the shell and head of which are very perceptibly several shades lighter than the bagdas.

It is impossible to quote any price as a guide, the fluctuation being almost incredible. Fine large
prawns, not lobsters--prawns which, without their heads, would be about the size of the ordinary
dried Normandy pippins sent out to this country for tarts--may be obtained one day at two annas for
twenty, and the next day they will not be procurable at less than eight annas for the same number.
This remark applies generally to fish of every description brought for sale into the Calcutta market.

With one  other remark of  importance, we  shall proceed to the  instructions necessary for  the
preparation of prawn malay gravy curry.

The prawns should be parboiled after removing the heads, to rid them, as the natives call it, of
besine, which means all disagreeable character of fishy smell and taste.

As a rule, the heads of prawns should always be rejected, which, in the process of frying, absorb
largely the ghee, and in the cooking dispel a liquid from their spongy formation.

In all other respects, the prawn malay gravy curry is cooked like the chicken malay gravy curry,
omitting the ginger; but an additional blade or two of the lemon-grass would not be amiss, which, on
the curry being dished, are thrown away.

57.--Chicken Malay Gravy Curry with Pulwal

Take a fat chicken, clean it, remove all the flesh and pound it to a pulp, and prepare it in every
respect as directed in recipe No. 34 for a cofta curry, omitting the suet. Take a dozen large-sized
pulwals, scrape or pare away the outer skin, split them down one side, extract all the seeds, &c., and
throw the pulwals into cold water; wash and drain away all the water, then stuff them with the
prepared forcemeat, tie them with fine sewing cotton, and cook them in the milk of the cocoanut,
exactly as directed in recipe No. 55.

58.--Prawn Malay Gravy Curry with Pulwal

Take bagda prawns; shell and clean them, pound to a pulp, and prepare as directed in recipe No. 37
for prawn cofta curry. Take a dozen pulwals, peel them finely, cut them open lengthways, clear them
of all seeds, &c., wash and dry them, then stuff them with the prepared prawn mince; tie the pulwals
with sewing cotton, and cook in cocoanut milk as directed in recipe No. 56.

59.--Chicken Malay Doopiaja

The condiments and ingredients are as follow:--One chittack and a half or three ounces of ghee, one
teaspoonful and a half of salt, four teaspoonfuls of ground onions, one  teaspoonful of ground
turmeric, one teaspoonful of ground chilies, half a teaspoonful of ground ginger, a quarter of a
teaspoonful of ground garlic, one cup of strong cocoanut milk, and one dozen onions cut lengthways
into fine slices.

Cut up the chicken in the usual manner, warm the ghee, fry and set aside the sliced onions, then fry
brown the ground condiments, after which add the chicken and salt. When fried brown, pour in the
cocoanut milk and the fried onions finely chopped, and allow to simmer over a slow fire: the Malay
doopiaja will be ready in an hour.

60.--Prawn Malay Doopiaja

Take sixteen or twenty large bagda prawns, throw away the heads, parboil the prawns, and then
doopiaje in all respects as for a chicken Malay doopiaja, omitting the ginger.

PORTUGUESE CURRY (VINDALOO OR BINDALOO)

This well-known Portuguese curry can only be made properly of beef, pork, or duck. The following

26 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

is a recipe of the vindaloo in general use:--

Six ounces or three chittacks of ghee or lard, one tablespoonful of bruised garlic, one tablespoonful
of  ground garlic, one  tablespoonful of  ground ginger, two teaspoonfuls of  ground chilies, one
teaspoonful  of   roasted   and   ground   coriander-seed,   half   a   teaspoonful  of   roasted   and   ground
cumin-seed, two or three bay-leaves, a few peppercorns, four or five cloves, roasted and ground,
four or five cardamoms, roasted and ground, six small sticks of cinnamon, roasted and ground, with
half a cup of good vinegar, to two pounds of pork or beef or a duck.

N.B.--The best vindaloo is that prepared with mustard oil.

61.--Beef Vindaloo

Cut up two pounds of fat beef into large squares, and steep them in the vinegar, together with half a
teaspoonful of salt and all the ground condiments, from eighteen to twenty-four hours. Then warm
the ghee or lard and throw in the meat, together with the condiments and vinegar in which it had
been steeped, adding a few peppercorns and bay-leaves, and allow to simmer gently over a slow fire
for two hours, or until the meat is perfectly tender, and serve up hot.

62.--Pork Vindaloo

Cut up two pounds of fat pork into large squares, and curry according to the directions given in the
foregoing recipe, omitting the cloves, cardamoms, and cinnamon.

63.--Duck Vindaloo

Take a young, full-grown, but tender duck; cut it up as for a curry, and put it through the same
course of pickling from eighteen to twenty-four hours before being cooked.

64.--Pickled Vindaloo (adapted as a Present to Friends at a Distance)

If the following instructions be carried out carefully, the vindaloo will keep good for months, and, if
required, may be sent as an acceptable present to friends at home.

In order to keep it good sufficiently long to be sent home round the Cape, select the fattest parts of
pork; satisfy yourself that the meat is fresh and sound, and that it has not been washed with water in
the butcher's shop. Cut the meat into two-inch squares, wash thoroughly in vinegar (no water), rub
over  with   the  following condiments,   and  then  steep   them  in   really  good  English  vinegar   for
twenty-four hours:--Garlic  bruised, not ground down, dry ginger powdered, turmeric powdered,
peppercorns roasted and powdered, coriander-seeds roasted and powdered, cumin-seeds roasted and
powdered, and dry salt.

Melt a large quantity of the best mustard oil in an earthen pot, and, according to the quantity of
meat, take additional condiments mentioned above, but in the proportion given in recipe No. 61;
grind in vinegar, and fry in the oil; then put in the meat, and all the vinegar, &c., in which it had
been stepped, together with some more salt, a little more vinegar, a few bay-leaves and peppercorns,
and allow to simmer until the meat is quite tender. Remove from the fire and allow it to get quite
cold; then put it into dry stone jars, with patent screw tops, well filled with plenty of the oil in which
the vindaloo was cooked. Take care that all the meat is well covered over with oil, which latter
ought to be at least from two to three inches above the meat in the jar. Screw down the lid, and
cover it over with a good sound bladder to render it perfectly air-tight.

When required for use, take out only as much as will suffice, and simply warm it in a little of its own
gravy.

65.--Curry Paste

Is likewise  adapted for  sending  as a  present  to  friends at  home. It  is  made   in the  following
manner:--Eight ounces of dhunnia, or coriander-seed, roasted; one ounce of jeerah, or cumin-seed,

27 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

roasted; two ounces of huldee, or dry turmeric; two ounces of lal mirritch, dry chilies; two ounces of
kala mirritch, black pepper, roasted; two ounces of rai, or mustard-seed; one ounce of soat, or dry
ginger; one ounce of lussan, or garlic; four ounces of nimmuck, salt; four ounces of cheenee, or
sugar; four ounces of chunna or gram dal without husk, and roasted. The above ingredients, in the
proportions given, to be carefully pounded and ground down with the best English white wine
vinegar to the consistency of a thick jelly; then warm some good sweet oil, and while bubbling fry in
it the mixture until it is reduced to a paste; let it cool, and then bottle it.

N.B.--Great care must be taken not to use any water in the preparation, and mustard oil is better
adapted than sweet oil for frying the mixture in.

MADRAS MULLIGATAWNY CURRY

As this dish is usually served up and partaken of in the place of ordinary soup, reference will be
made to it hereafter under the head of "Soups."

Before proceeding to remark on fish, vegetable, and peas curries, a few useful hints and suggestions
may be offered on meat curries generally.

In many families the remains of cold meat, if not required for other purposes, are made into curry:
cold roast or boiled mutton is admirably adapted for the purpose; and in ninety-nine cases out of a
hundred consumers cannot tell the difference. If there be any difference or advantage, it is decidedly
in favour of the cold meat: the roasting joints are always of a superior quality to meats sold under
the designation of "curry meats."

The  remains of cold roast beef make the best cofta curries, croquets, &c., and if the  beef be
under-done no fresh beef will make a better doopiaja.

Vegetables are sometimes put into gravy meat curries, never into doopiajas; but, as a  rule, the
introduction of vegetable into any meat curry is objectionable, from the fact that all vegetables in
the process of boiling or cooking throw out a liquid, some more and some less: the potato throws out
the least, but of a disagreeable character. It is true potatoes may be boiled before being put into a
curry, but the piquancy and peculiarity of flavour looked for in a curry is so palpably destroyed that
the innovation may be discovered with closed eyes. The introduction of vegetable into gravy fish
curries, however, is no innovation, as the condiments used for the one answer for the other; both are
cooked in oil, and the ginger omitted.

66.--Gravy Fish Curries

The condiments are as follows:--Mustard oil, one chittack or two ounces; water, two cups; four
teaspoonfuls of ground onions, one teaspoonful of ground turmeric, one  teaspoonful of ground
chilies, and a quarter of a teaspoonful of garlic.

It will be noticed that mustard oil is used instead of ghee, and no ginger.

Too much care cannot be observed in thoroughly cleaning, rubbing, and washing the fish in salt and
water before cooking it for the  table. Fish, if properly washed, when served up will never be
offensive, unless it be bad when purchased.

67.--Hilsa Fish Gravy Curry

The head and tail are thrown away, and the fish cut into slices of rather more than half an inch thick;
these should be washed in several waters with salt, to rid them of all "besine," before they are
curried.

The acid of tamarind is considered an improvement, or "amchoor," which is sliced green mangoe
dried in salt.

68.--Beckty Fish Gravy Curry

28 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

Is sliced and washed in salt like the hilsa before being cooked. It is not usual to put any acid in the
beckty fish curry.

69.--Prawn Doopiaja

Take one chittack and a half of mustard oil, four teaspoonfuls of ground onions, one teaspoonful of
ground turmeric, one teaspoonful of ground chilies, a quarter of a teaspoonful of garlic, twelve curry
onions cut lengthways, each into six or eight slices, one cupful of water, and twelve large prawns.

Clean and thoroughly wash the prawns, rejecting the heads, or taking only their substance pounded
and squeezed out with unroasted coriander-seed, and after parboiling the prawns make the doopiaja
in all respects according to the ordinary mode.

70.--Sliced Hilsa Fish Fried in Curry Condiments

Take two teaspoonfuls of ground onions, one teaspoonful of ground chilies, two teaspoonfuls of salt,
half a teaspoonful of ground turmeric, a quarter of a teaspoonful of ground garlic, and one chittack
of mustard oil.

After slicing a hilsa in the manner directed for a curry, and having thoroughly cleaned and washed it
with salt, rub into the slices all the ground condiments and the remaining salt, and allow them to
remain for at least an hour. Warm the oil, and fry the slices of fish of a very light and bright brown.
Serve up hot.

71.--Sliced Beckty Fish Fried in Curry Condiments

Slice, wash, and fry exactly as directed above. Fish served up in this manner is well suited to some
European tastes, and makes an agreeable change to the ordinary mode of frying fish for breakfast.

72.--Egg Curry

Take six or eight eggs, boil hard, shell, cut into halves, and set them aside; take ghee, ground
condiments, and sliced fried onions, in all respects the same as for a chicken doopiaja, and observe
precisely the same method of cooking, keeping in mind the fact that, the eggs being already cooked
or boiled, a smaller quantity of water and a shorter time to simmer will suffice.

73.--Egg Curry with Green Peas

This is a favourite curry with some families in winter, when the English green peas are procurable.
The method of preparing it is exactly the same as recipe No. 71, allowing the curry to simmer until
the peas are quite tender.

74.--Egg Curry, with Chunna Ka Dal

Parboil and dal, say half a cupful; curry the dal first; when about nearly cooked, throw in the
hard-boiled eggs, and finish the simmering immediately the dal is soft or tender.

CHAHKEES

Chahkee is a term applied to vegetable curries, some of which are deservedly popular, and one in
particular, which many families have daily during the season the vegetables are procurable, and yet
never tire of, viz.--

75.--Seam, Potato, and Peas Chahkee

Take twenty seams, four new potatoes, and a quarter of a seer of green peas; divide each seam into
three pieces, and throw into a bowl of water; divide each potato into four pieces, and throw into
water; shell the peas, wash all thoroughly, put into a colander to drain, and cook with the following
condiments:--One  chittack and a  half of  mustard oil, four teaspoonfuls of ground onions, one

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

teaspoonful of ground chilies, half a teaspoonful of ground turmeric, a quarter of a teaspoonful of
ground garlic, one teaspoonful and a half of salt, and one cupful of water. Warm the oil, let it bubble
well, and fry the ground condiments; when these are quite brown put in the vegetables and salt; let
the whole fry, stirring it well; then add the water, and allow it to simmer over a slow fire until the
vegetables are quite tender.

N.B.--A cauliflower may be added if required for a change.

76.--Pulwal, Potatoes, and Torrie

Clean as much of the above three kinds of vegetables as will overfill a vegetable-dish, and make the
chahkee in all respects as the foregoing.

77.--Red Pumpkin and Tamarind

A quarter of a red pumpkin and the pulp of two or three tamarinds will be enough. Dissolve the pulp
of the tamarind in the water, and put it into the curry after the pumpkin has been fried.

78.--White Pumpkin and Tamarind

Chahkee it in the same way as the red pumpkin.

79.--White Pumpkin, Plain, Cut Small

It is not necessary to give any further instructions than those already given.

80.--Tomato with Tamarind

Take twenty tomatoes and the pulp of two or three tamarinds, and chahkee as directed for red
pumpkin.

81.--Tomato, Plain

Chahkee twenty tomatoes according to instructions given for other chahkees.

N.B.--There is a fresh green herb called soa mattee, which is sometimes put into fish, vegetable, and
other curries. Some Europeans like the flavour, and have it daily when procurable. Inquiry and trial
are recommended.

SAUG CURRIES

Half an anna's worth of any saug will suffice for a party of four, for curries made of greens, such as
spinach, &c. The following condiments, &c., are used:--One chittack and a half of mustard oil, four
teaspoonfuls of ground onions, one teaspoonful of ground chilies, half a teaspoonful of ground
turmeric, a quarter of a teaspoonful of ground garlic, one teaspoonful and a half of ground salt, and
one cupful of water.

82.--Red Saug and Omra

The omra should be peeled, and half fried if large. Great care must be taken to thoroughly clean and
wash the greens. Put them into a colander and allow all the water to drain away. Then warm the oil,
and fry the ground condiments; then the saug and omra, and when crisp add the water and cook
over a slow fire until the greens and omra are tender.

83.--Red Saug, Omra, and Shrimps

Observe in all respects the same process as that required in cooking without the shrimps, omitting
the ginger.

84.--Red Saug and Prawns

30 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

The prawns should be parboiled, and then follow all the instructions in recipe No. 82.

85.--Green Saug with Prawns

Proceed in every particular as with the last.

86.--Danta Curry with Shrimps

The danta is a fine delicate long green pod which the horseradish-tree yields, and contains small
peas; these pods are cut into lengths of three or four inches and cooked with shrimps. Beyond this
explanation it is not necessary to enlarge upon the instructions already given.

87.--Khuttah Carree, or Acid Vegetable Curry

Take small quantities of all kinds of vegetables in season, but the best curry is that made of potatoes,
kutchoo or artichoke, sweet potatoes or suckercund, carrots, red and white pumpkins, and tomatoes.

The   vegetables   should   be   cut   into   large   pieces,   and   boiled   in   water   with   the   following
condiments:--Four teaspoonfuls of ground onions, one teaspoonful each of ground turmeric and
chilies, a quarter of a teaspoonful of ground garlic, and one teaspoonful of roasted and ground
coriander-seed.

Prepare two large cups of tamarind water, slightly sweetened with jaggry, strain through a sieve, and
add the strained water to the boiled vegetables with a few fresh chilies. Then melt in a separate pot
one chittack or two ounces of mustard oil. While the oil is bubbling, fry in it a teaspoonful of the
collinga, or onion-seeds, and when sufficiently fried pour it over the boiled vegetables including the
tamarind water. Close up the pot, and allow it to simmer for fifteen to twenty minutes, when it will
be ready. It is eaten cold.

BHAHJEES

By bhahjee is meant fried. The two most generally approved vegetable bhahjees are those made of
bringals and pulwals. The following are the condiments, &c., used:--Mustard oil according to the
quantity of vegetable to be fried, a little ground turmeric and chilies, and some salt.

88.--Bringal Bhahjee

Take young full-sized bringals; wash them thoroughly, and slice them about an eighth of an inch
thick; dry them, steep them for half an hour in the ground condiments and salt, fry in oil, and serve
up hot.

89.--Pulwal Bhahjee

Take a dozen or more pulwals--a most excellent and wholesome native vegetable,--scrape or pare
away very finely the upper green coating, divide them lengthways into two pieces, clear away all the
seeds, &c., wash, drain away all the water, and steep them in ground turmeric, chilies, and salt for
half an hour or longer; then fry them quite crisp in melted mustard oil. They are much liked by some
Europeans.

N.B.--The vegetable called ram's horns or lady's fingers, known by the natives as dharus, makes an
excellent bhahjee; so does the kerrella, a small green and intensely bitter native vegetable, which
comes into the market in March and April; it is not, however, well suited to the European taste.

DAL OR PEAS CURRIES

Half   an   anna's   worth   of   any   dal   will   suffice   for   a   party   of   four.   The   condiments   are   as
follow:--Three-quarters of a chittack of ghee, four teaspoonfuls of ground onions, one teaspoonful
of ground chilies, half a teaspoonful of ground turmeric, half a teaspoonful of ground ginger, a
quarter of a teaspoonful of ground garlic, one teaspoonful and a half of salt, and half a dozen onions

31 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

cut into six or eight slices each.

90.--Moong Dal

Take half a pound of the raw dal, or say half a cupful; clean, pick, and roast it; mix it up with all the
ground condiments and salt, put into a pot, pour water over the whole, some two inches above the
dal, and boil it well, until the dal has quite dissolved. Be careful not to disturb it while in the process
of boiling, but allow it to cake as it were en masse. When thoroughly boiled, churn the dal by
twirling it in a wooden instrument called a ghootnee; then warm the ghee in a separate pot, fry the
onions, chop them, and throw into the churned dal, after which pour the dal into the pot of melted
ghee, and keep stirring until the dal and ghee have well mixed; then put the cover on, and allow to
simmer over a slow fire for about a quarter of an hour.

N.B.--The standard price of the best roasted moong dal is two annas and a half per seer.

91.--Mussoor or Red Dal

The process in all respects for preparing and cooking the red dal is the same as for the moong dal,
excepting that, instead of fried sliced onions, a large clove of garlic is cut up small, fried, and takes
the place of the onions.

The price of the best quality mussoor dal, free of husk, is two annas per seer.

92.--Mussoor Dal with Amchoor or with Tamarind

Put the amchoor, or, if preferred, tamarind, into the pot with the dal; allow it to dissolve, and when
the dal is going through the process of bring churned remove the hard stones of the amchoor or
seeds of the tamarind.

93.--Mussoor Dal Chur Churree

Instead of only half a dozen onions, take a dozen, and cut them into fine slices lengthways. Warm
the three-quarters of a chittack of ghee, fry and set aside the sliced onions, then fry all the ground
condiments; next put in and fry the dal, having previously washed it well, soaked it in water for
about a quarter of an hour, and drained it through a colander. When thoroughly fried and browned,
add only a little water, barely sufficient to cover the fried dal, and allow to simmer from ten to
fifteen minutes, or until the dal has dissolved. Serve up, strewing over it the fried onions. If chunna
ka dal be used, soak it for an hour.

Other dals are occasionally served up, but very rarely at European tables. The price of the best clean
chunna ka dal rarely exceeds two annas per seer.

94.--Dal Foolaree

Is much liked by Europeans, but is rarely served up well, owing to the trouble and time required in
making it properly.

For the recipe see No. 223.

BURTAS OR MASHES

Burtas are mashes of potatoes and other vegetables, cold meats, dry fish, &c.; they are palatable,
and much liked by most Europeans as accompaniments to curry and rice. The ingredients to almost
every burta are the fine large white Patna onions, fresh green chilies, and the juice of fresh lemons.

95.--Potato Burta

Take a moderate or middling sized white Panta onion; remove the outer coats, and slice very fine;
then slice or cut up two hot green chilies, and squeeze over the onion and chilies the juice of a fresh
lime: allow to soak. Take  eight  or  ten well-boiled  potatoes, half a  teaspoonful of  salt, and  a
teaspoonful of good mustard oil; bruise the potatoes down with a large silver or plated fork, adding,
when they are half bruised, the onions and chilies, with as much only of the lime-juice as may be
agreeable: mix all well together with a light hand, so that the potatoes may not cake, and yet be well
and thoroughly mashed and mixed.

96.--Brinjal Burta

Prepare the sliced onions, chilies, and lime-juice in the manner directed for potato burta. Take two
fine young brinjals of large size; carefully and thoroughly roast them in a quick ash fire; remove the
ashes and burnt parts of the skin, if any; then open the brinjals, and with a clean spoon remove the
contents to as near the skin as possible, to which add a good teaspoonful of salt and teaspoonful of
mustard oil; work these with a spoon to a perfect pulp, throwing away the lumps or shreds if any;
then mix with it all the onions, chilies, and lime-juice. If not to your taste, add more  salt or
lime-juice, according to fancy.

97.--Dry Fish Burta

Prepare onions, chilies, and lime-juice as before. Take a part of the Arabian dried beckty and well
broil it; remove all the bones, and pound the fish to nearly a powder; mix it thoroughly with a
teaspoonful of mustard oil, and add the onions, chilies, and lime-juice.

98.--Red Herring Burta

Take onions, chilies, and lime-juice. Place the herring, with its original paper packing, on a gridiron,
or on a frying-pan, and warm it well; then clear it of all skin, very carefully pick out all the bones,

33 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

bruise the herring, and mix it thoroughly with the sliced onions, chilies, and lime-juice.

N.B.--This is an inimitable burta.

99.--Cold Corned-Beef Burta

Steep sliced onions and chilies in lime-juice; have the red well-corned part of a cold round of beef
nicely pounded; add to it the onions, chilies, and as much of the lime-juice as may be desirable.

100.--Cold Tongue Burta

The remains of a well-corned cold tongue make an excellent burta, as per recipe for cold beef burta.

101.--Cold Ham Burta

Is made in the same way as the beef and tongue burtas.

102.--Green Mango Burta

The condiments for this burta are a quarter of a teaspoonful of ground chilies, half a teaspoonful of
ground fresh mint-leaves, half a teaspoonful of ground ginger, half a teaspoonful of salt, and a
teaspoonful of sugar.

Take two ordinary large-size green mangoes; peel, divide, and throw them into clean water, remove
the stones, then bruise them to a perfect pulp with the aid of the curry-stone and muller. Care must
be taken that the stone is perfectly clean, and will not impart the flavour of garlic or turmeric to the
burta. Mix the sugar well with the pulp; if the mango be very acid, add a little more sugar; then mix
it with the salt and ground condiments; more salt or sugar may be added if required.

103.--Tomato Burta

Bake in an oven a dozen good-sized tomatoes until the skin cracks; break them down, and mix with
them a little ground chilies, ginger, salt, and half a teaspoonful of good mustard oil. A small squeeze
of lemon-juice may be added if desired.

SOUPS

34 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

A digester is best adapted for boiling soups in, as no steam can escape, and consequently less water
is required than in a common pot.

To extract the substance or essence of meat, long and slow boiling over a charcoal fire is absolutely
necessary. In the first instance, however, it is desirable to boil up the meat with pepper and salt on a
quick, brisk fire, and take away all the black scum which rises to the surface; then pour a little cold
water into the pot to raise up the white scum, which also remove, and reduce the fire, taking care
that in the process of slow-boiling the pot is never off the boil.

104.--Shin of Beef Soup

Take a shin of beef, cut it up small, wash it thoroughly, and boil with pepper and salt in sufficient
water to well cover the meat. Let it boil over a brisk fire, taking away the black scum; add a little
cold water, and skim off the white scum; then reduce the fire, and allow the soup to simmer until it
somewhat thickens; strain the soup, cut away all the fat, season with soup herbs, and add more
pepper and salt if necessary. Give it a good boil up, and then clear it with the white of an egg well
beaten up, after which add a tablespoonful of Lea & Perrin's Worcestershire sauce, and half a
wineglassful of sherry.

105.--Shin of Beef Soup, with Forcemeat and Egg Balls

Prepare a shin of beef soup in all respects according to the above directions; clear with an egg well
beaten up, add to it sauce, sherry, forcemeat, and egg balls.

106.--Vermicelli Soup

Prepare  a   shin  of   beef   soup  as directed  above,  omitting the   sauce   and  sherry.  Parboil  some
vermicelli, and after clearing the soup with the white of an egg, add to it the parboiled vermicelli,
and give it all a good boil up before serving.

107.--Macaroni Soup

Prepare a shin of beef soup as directed above, omitting the sauce and wine; boil some macaroni until
perfectly tender; clear the soup with the white of an egg, then add the boiled macaroni, and warm up
before serving.

108.--Mulligatawny Soup

Prepare a shin of beef soup as above, omitting the sauce, wine, and white of egg; set the soup aside.
Take a full-sized curry chicken; cut it up into sixteen or eighteen pieces, and wash them thoroughly.
Warm a pot and melt it into two chittacks or four ounces of ghee; fry in it some finely-sliced onions,
and set aside. Then fry in the melted ghee the following condiments, &c.:--Four teaspoonfuls of
ground onions, one  teaspoonful of  ground turmeric, one  teaspoonful of  ground chilies,  half  a
teaspoonful of ground ginger, a quarter of a teaspoonful of ground garlic, half a teaspoonful of
roasted   and   ground   coriander-seed,   and   a   quarter   of   a   teaspoonful   of   roasted   and   ground
cumin-seed.

Sprinkle a little water over these while frying; then add the cut-up chicken with two teaspoonfuls of
salt. When nearly brown, add one chittack or two ounces of roasted and ground poppy-seeds; pour
in the beef soup, add the fried onion and half a dozen of the kurreah fool leaves, close the pot, and
allow the whole to simmer over a slow fire until the chicken be perfectly tender. Serve up hot, with
limes cut in slices on a separate plate.

109.--Another Way

Prepare a shin of beef as directed above. Cut up a chicken; wash it and set it aside. Heat a pot and
melt in it two chittacks or four ounces of ghee. After frying in it and setting aside some finely-sliced
onions, fry the condiments in the proportions given in the foregoing recipe; then add the cut-up
chicken with two teaspoonfuls of salt; brown it nicely; have ready two chittacks or four ounces of

35 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

roasted and ground chunna ka or gram dal, which mix thoroughly in a cup of strong cocoanut milk,
and pour over the chicken just as it has become brown; stir it well, and add the fried onions and the
soup, with half a dozen of the kurreah fool leaves; close the pot, and allow the whole to simmer for
three-quarters of an hour. Serve up hot, with limes, either whole or cut in slices, on a separate plate.

110.--Delicious Curry Soup

Prepare a strong beef soup; slice some onions, and cut up a chicken; take curry condiments as
directed above, omitting the coriander and cumin seed; melt two chittacks or four ounces of ghee;
fry and set aside the sliced onions, then fry the condiments, add the cut-up chicken, and fry that
also. In a part of the beef soup boil a spoonful of tamarind, so as to separate the stocks and stones;
strain and stir it into the fried chicken. After a while add the remainder of the beef soup, with half a
dozen kurreah fool leaves, and the friend onions; close up the pot, and continue to simmer the
whole until the chicken is quite tender. Serve up hot.

111.--Bright Onion Soup

Take a shoulder of veal; cut it up small, breaking all the bones; wash it thoroughly, put it into a pan
with pepper, salt, and water, boil it well, and remove all the scum as it rises; reduce the fire, and let
it simmer until the meat is perfectly dissolved; strain it, cut away all the fat, add soup herbs, and
more pepper and salt if required; give it a boil up, and clear it with the white of an egg well beaten
up; slice very fine some pure silvery white Patna onions, and steep them in boiling water, changing
the water three or four times, every ten minutes; drain away all the water and add the onions to the
soup; boil, and serve up hot.

112.--Bridal Soup, or Soup Elegant

Take two large shoulders of veal; cut them up small, bones and all, and, after washing thoroughly,
boil over a brisk fire, with white pepper and the best white salt. Be careful that the scum that rises is
well skimmed; reduce the fire, and allow it to simmer until the meat falls off the bones; strain the
soup, let it cool, and then thoroughly free it of all fat; return it into a clean digester, add more salt
and white pepper if necessary, and some white stocks of celery; boil it, and clear it with the whites
of two eggs well beaten up; strain through flannel and set aside.

Take the best and most transparent parts of a calf's head and the tongue, and boil perfectly tender
without reducing them to shreds, being careful to remove all the scum that rises to the surface; lay
the boiled tongue and meat out on a clean dish; slice the tongue fine, and cut out all manner of
devices, such as, diamonds, squares, circles, hearts, stars, &c.; do the same with the best and
cleanest parts of meat selected from the head; take care that no particles of scum or other impurities
be adhering to them; where any does adhere, rinse it off in a little of the cleared soup; then place
them carefully into the tureen in which it is purposed to serve up the soup. If fancy macaroni be
procurable, a tablespoonful may be boiled tender, free of all particles of dust or powder, and added
to the cut-up meat and tongue, over which pour the boiling-hot soup; add to it a wineglassful of the
palest sherry, and serve up hot.

N.B.--The calf's tongue and meat of the head may be boiled with the veal, but they should be
removed when tender, and not allowed to dissolve with the longer simmering of the veal.

This is an elegant soup, beautifully transparent, and of the colour of light champagne.

113.--Soup Royal

Take a shin of beef, the best parts of meat cut off from a calf's head, and the tongue; cut the beef
into small particles, but leave the tongue and the meat from the calf's head whole; add pepper and
salt, and boil well, clearing the scum as it rises; remove the tongue and the meat of the calf's head
when sufficiently tender, but continue to boil the shin of beef until it is well dissolved; then strain it,
and cut away all the fat; put it up again with plenty of soup herbs, and more salt and pepper if
necessary; boil it well up; squeeze into the soup the juice of half a lemon, and skim it well; strain it
once more, and set it aside.

36 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

Cut the tongue into slices of an eighth of an inch thick, trim them into the shape of large diamonds,
and set aside. Cut up the meat of the calf's head into one-inch squares and strips of an inch and a
half long and half an inch wide; add to these a few ready-fried circular flat brain cakes, make also a
few egg balls and forcemeat balls, and, after cooking, add them to the rest of the meat, tongue, &c.,
and set aside.

Take four red carrots, one pound of green peas, half a pound of boiled potatoes, one large turnip,
one large Patna onion, a quarter of a pound of roasted and ground split peas or gram dal, some soup
herbs, pepper, and salt, the pulp of one orange, and the peels of half an orange and half a lemon. Put
these into a stewpan with water sufficient to cover the whole; boil them thoroughly, skimming all the
while; when perfectly dissolved, turn them out into a colander and allow all the water to drain away;
then turn the contents of the colander into a sieve, and pass the vegetables, &c., through it, rejecting
all such as will not pass. Add the whole, or a part of the strained vegetables to the soup, which
should not be thicker in consistency than a good thick potato soup.

Next stew one dozen good French prunes in a claret-glassful of port wine, which also strain through
a sieve, rejecting stones, &c., and add the strained portion to the soup; then boil the whole, strain it
once more, add to it all the forcemeat and egg balls, the brain cakes, tongue, &c., and serve up,
adding to it more salt, wine, or sauce, if needed.

N.B.--This soup properly made is without its equal.

FISH

114.--Fish Mooloo

Fry the fish and let it cool. Scrape a cocoanut, put a teacupful of hot water into it, rub it well, strain
it and put aside; then put two spoonfuls more of water; strain this also; cut up three or four green
chilies, and as many onions as you like, with half a garlic. Fry them with a little ghee, and whilst
frying put the last straining of the cocoanut water in with the ingredients till it is dry; then add the
first water of the nut, and pour the whole over the fish, with some vinegar, ginger, whole pepper, and
salt to your taste.

115.--Another Way

Fry in a little ghee three or four chilies cut up, half a clove of garlic, and some sliced onions. When

37 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

half fried, add two tablespoonfuls of cocoanut milk, and continue to fry until dry; then stir into it a
teacupful of cocoanut milk, a little vinegar, some sliced ginger, peppercorns, and salt to taste, and
while hot pour it over a cold fried or boiled fish.

116.--Another Way

Cut up a fish into small, two-inch squares, and fry in ghee, with egg, bread-crumbs, and turmeric, of
a nice brown colour. Boil in cocoanut milk some sliced green ginger and sliced green chilies; then
add the fish, with salt to taste, and let it stew until the sauce has thickened. Serve up hot.

117.--Prawn Cutlet

Shell and wash the prawns; remove the heads, but leave the tails; slit them down in the centre, and
gently beat them flat with a rolling-pin; sprinkle them with pepper and salt, and some finely-minced
soup herbs; rub them over with yolk of eggs, and dredge with flour; fry over a very moderate fire to
a rich light brown colour. Garnish the dish with fried green parsley, or serve up with tomato sauce
gravy as per recipe No. 300.

118.--Crabs in Shell

Clean and boil the crabs in salt; remove them out of the shells; pick and clean them well, and
reserve the coral for dressing.

Chop and mince fine the crabs; add some onion and ginger juice, a little lime-juice, pepper, and salt,
and a  little  mushroom catsup. Melt  some  butter, and fry the  mixture  in it  until the butter  be
absorbed; then add a little stock, and remove from the fire immediately the stock begins to dry.
Butter the shells, and fill with the mixture. The meat of six crabs will refill five shells. Take some
finely-sifted bread-crumbs; grind down the coral, and put it over the mixture on the shells, with the
bread-crumbs, and bits of butter; bake for a few minutes.

119.--Tamarind Fish

Make a thick pickle of ripe tamarinds, good English vinegar, and a little salt; pass through a sieve,
rejecting all stones and fibres. Select really good fresh hilsa fish, full size, with roes. Remove all the
scales and fins, cut away the heads and tails, remove the roes, clean out the fish inside, and then
slice up, an inch thick. Wipe away all blood, &c., with a clean dry towel. Care must be taken to use
no water in the cleaning of the fish or in the preparation of the pickle. The board on which the fish is
cut up, and also the knife, must be very clean. After all the blood, &c., has been thoroughly cleaned
and wiped away, lay out the slices of fish and roe on a clean dish, sprinkle thickly with salt, and
place over them a wire dish-cover to keep away the flies. Four or five hours afterwards put a layer
of the pickle into a wide-mouthed bottle or jar, and a thick coating of pickle over each slice of fish
and the roes, after washing away the salt with a little vinegar; lay them in order in the jar, until the
last of the fish is put in; then be careful to put in a very thick layer of the pickle. Cork the jar
securely, and tie it down with a good bladder to keep it air-tight, and in three weeks it will be fit for
use. It is desirable to fill each jar well up to the mouth, to effect which the jars or bottles to be
selected should be of the required size.

N.B.--If the fish be  really fresh, all the ingredients of good quality, and no water used in the
operation of cleaning and pickling, the jars well filled, and mouths secured with sound bladder, the
fish will keep good for months, and will be fit to send home.

120.--Smoked Fish

The mango fish, beckty, or hilsa should be cut down the back, spread open, and well washed and
salted. Have a bright charcoal fire, and sprinkle over it some bran, with brown sugar; cover the fire
with an open-work bamboo basket, having over it a coarse duster; arrange the fish over the duster,
and allow them to smoke. When one side has browned, turn and brown the other side. As the smoke
decreases, add more bran, and fan up the fire. A duster thrown over the fish while smoking will
facilitate the operation.

121.--Dried Prawns

Strip the prawns of their shells; keep them for a day in salt mixed with turmeric; then string and put
them out in the sun daily for fifteen or twenty days.

122.--Prawn Powder

Take a seer of dry prawns; wash them well, dry over the fire until crisp, pound fine, with some red
pepper and nutmeg, pass through a sieve, and bottle for use. A teaspoonful spread over bread and
butter is considered a relish.

JOINTS, MADE DISHES, ETC.

123.--Corned Round of Beef

Select a good round of beef four days previously to it being required for the table, together with two
seers of cooking salt, eight fresh juicy limes, one anna-worth of saltpetre, and a tablespoonful of
suckur, a description of moist brown sugar. Pound fine the saltpetre; put the rind of four limes, pared
fine, into a marble mortar, with a tablespoonful of brandy or other spirit; bruise and pound it well,
adding to it the suckur or brown sugar, and gradually half the powdered saltpetre; mix all well
together. Take one seer of the salt, and mix into it the contents of the marble mortar; divide the
mixture into four equal parts, and rub briskly one-fourth part of it into the round; puncture the beef
lightly during the operation with a clean bright steel sailmaker's needle, to allow the mixture to
penetrate more freely. An hour or two after take another fourth of the mixture; squeeze into it the
juice of the four limes from which the rind had been removed, and repeat the operation of rubbing it
into the round, puncturing it lightly with the needle; turn the beef over from side to side continually,
so that one side do not soak or steep more in the brine than another; repeat the operation of rubbing

it well several times during the day. Next morning place it on a dry dish, and rub into it another
fourth part of the prepared salt; let it stand for an hour or so, then pour over it the old brine; repeat
the rubbing two or three times during the day, turning the beef continually. On the third day rub half
of the remaining saltpetre into the beef dry, and allow it to stand for an hour or two; then add the
rest of the saltpetre and the juice of the four limes to the remaining fourth part of the mixture, in
which keep turning and rubbing the beef during the day as before; in the evening pour over it the
stale brine, cover it thickly with the one seer of remaining salt, and place a heavy weight upon it,
until required to be boiled the next day.

124.--Beef a la Mode

Corn a round of beef in every particular as directed above, and twenty-four hours previously to its
being cooked lard it as follows with the undermentioned ingredients:--Four pounds of lard or fat
bacon, half a tablespoonful of cinnamon powdered, half a seer or one pound of finely-powdered
pepper, one tablespoonful of cloves powdered, and four tablespoonfuls of chutnee strained through
muslin. Mix the ground pepper, ground hot spices, and strained chutnee with a claret-glassful of
mixed sauces, such as Harvey, walnut, Worcestershire, tap, tomato, &c. Cut up into long narrow
slips the lard or bacon to correspond in thickness with the larding-pin, and lay the slips into the
mixture of spices, sauces, &c., for an hour or two before larding the beef, which should be larded
through and through, and as closely as possible.

Cook it the next day, either in plain water, with half a pint of vinegar, and with bay-leaves and
peppercorns, as is usual, or in a preparation of claret or champagne with vinegar, bay-leaves, &c.
This is not necessary, but it tends to the improvement of the flavour at some considerable cost.

125.--Le Fricandeau de Veau

Take a large leg of veal; remove the knuckle-bone; corn and lard it in all respects like a beef à la
mode, reducing the ingredients in proportion to the difference in size and weight between a round of
beef and the leg of veal. Boil, baste, and glaze it well in the liquor in which it is boiled. Serve up with
all sorts of boiled and glazed vegetables.

126.--Hunter's Beef, or Spiced Beef

Corn a round of beef, as per recipe No. 123, with the addition of large quantities of finely-ground
pepper and hot spices. Some of the pepper and spice should be well rubbed in with the saltpetre, and
the beef should be punctured well the whole time with a needle to insure the saltpetre and spices
penetrating. After the dry saltpetre and spice have been well rubbed in, prepare a mixture of salt,
saltpetre, suckur, lemon-rind, pepper, and spice, and rub in one-fourth of the mixture, continuing to
puncture the beef. Add subsequently to the brine the juice of lemon, and observe closely all the
instructions given in recipe No. 123. On the seventh day remove the beef from the brine; rub it well
with two tablespoonfuls of finely-powdered spices and pepper; inclose it thoroughly in skins of fat,
and then in a strong coarse pie-crust, and bake it in a good oven. A baker's oven is the best.

127.--Collared Brisket

Bone a brisket of beef; rub into it saltpetre, suckur or brown sugar, and one seer of salt, with some
lime-juice; keep it in the brine for thirty-six hours, rubbing it continually. Then remove it from the
brine, and clear away all the salt. Roll the beef tightly into a collar, secure it well, inclose it in a stout
duster, and boil it.

128.--Spiced Collared Brisket

The process is the same as the above, but if the beef be required to keep for any lengthened time the
quantity of salt ought to be doubled, the beef kept in the brine for seventy-two hours, and hot spices,
pepper, chutnee, and sauces added. The beef after being rolled should be packed in the skin of fat,
then in a coarse pastry, instead of in plantain-leaf, and baked in a baker's oven.

129.--Pigeons with Petit Pois

40 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

Kill and feather, with plunging into hot water, four young, full-grown pigeons, taking care not to
break their skins; singe them, to destroy any remaining feathers; then wash them in three or four
cold waters, cut them in halves, dredge them well with salt and finely-sifted pepper, and allow to
remain for an hour. Then boil up two tablespoonfuls of ghee or lard, and fry the birds to a rich
brown, turning them over. When sufficiently browned, put in a cupful of beef stock, and allow to
simmer until the birds are quite tender; pour over them a tin of petit pois with their gravy, and serve
up hot.

130.--Ducks with Green Olives

Choose young, full-grown, tender ducks; feather and singe them as directed in the foregoing recipe,
after which wash them in three or four cold waters; stuff the ducks according to recipe No. 325, and
bake in a deep dish in a moderate oven until brown; then add a good beef stock with sliced onions,
and bake until the stock is reduced; remove the ducks, and put into the pan the contents of a bottle
of olives stoned, and allow to bake for ten or fifteen minutes to soften the olives; place the ducks on
a clean dish, arrange the olives round the ducks, and pour the gravy over. Serve up hot.

131.--Kidney Stew

Steep in lukewarm water for a few minutes a dozen mutton kidneys, and remove the white skin or
coat which will become perceptible; cut into halves or quarter them, wash in three or four waters,
and allow them to remain as long as possible in pepper, salt, and the juice of onions, ginger, and
garlic; boil up three dessertspoonfuls of ghee or lard in a deep frying-pan, throw in the kidneys with
the juice, put in half a clove of garlic, and cover over the whole with eight large Patna onions sliced
each into eight slices, and separated so as to cover over the whole surface of the pan; pour over it as
much hot stock as will keep all the onions under, and simmer over a slow fire until the onions
disappear, when serve up quite hot.

132.--French Mutton Chops

Take half a dozen chops cut from a breast of mutton, throwing away the intermediate bones--that is
to say, allow the meat of two chops to remain on one bone. Wash, dry, and steep the chops for an
hour or two before dinner in the juice of onions, ginger, and garlic--say four teaspoonfuls of the first
to three of the second and two of the last. Mix on a large board pepper, salt, and flour, with which
dredge the chops thoroughly, and fry quickly in boiling ghee or lard, taking care in turning over and
removing the chops not to use a fork or anything likely to occasion any wound to the chops, which
should be held by the bones with a pair of pincers. Serve up hot immediately they have become of a
good rich brown colour.

133.--Mutton Stew

Cut up a breast of mutton in the usual way for a stew; wash and dry the meat. Take of the juice of
onions one tablespoonful, of ginger half a tablespoonful, and of garlic a quarter of a tablespoonful;
mix with the meat, add pepper and salt, and allow to stand for any time from one to four hours.

Fry in a large stewpan two tablespoonfuls of ghee or lard, and when on the boil fry to a nice brown
all the meat only; afterwards pour in the liquor in which the meat has been steeped, and allow to
simmer for fifteen or twenty minutes; thicken some stock with a teaspoonful of flour, and add it to
the stew; allow to simmer until the meat is perfectly tender.

If vegetables be required (the addition of which, however, is not considered any improvement), the
original gravy, before adding the stock, must be removed and set aside.

Let the vegetables, consisting of, say, potatoes, carrots, turnips, and cut-up and sliced cabbage, after
being cleaned, remain for an hour or two in cold water; lay them over the meat, and pour in hot
stock sufficient to cover the whole of the meat and vegetables, and allow to simmer over a brisk
coal fire until quite tender; then pour into the pot the original gravy which had been removed, and
serve up hot.

41 of 98

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

Or, instead of the vegetables named above, take only twenty-five or thirty tomatoes, in which case
the stock should be lessened, as the tomatoes produce a large amount of liquid, and do not require as
much boiling as the harder vegetables.

134.--Mutton Brains and Love Apples

Take six brains, sixteen to twenty large tomatoes, two chittacks or four ounces of butter, and eight
biscuits. Wash the brains well; clean, boil, and halve, or cut each into three pieces; thoroughly butter
the dish which will be put on the table; dredge it well with finely-powdered biscuit; lay in the brains;
cut the tomatoes, and lay them in the dish between the brains, the cut ends upwards; add a small
cupful of good stock, and, after sprinkling a sufficient quantity of pepper and salt as a seasoning,
dredge thickly over with the ground biscuit-powder, and bake of a rich brown. Serve up hot.

135.--Kid Roasted Whole

Bespeak from a butcher a whole kid, with its head on.

Prepare a stuffing as per recipe No. 323 or 325, and after cleaning the kid, stuff into it the stuffing;
break the joints of the legs, and fold and truss them like a pig; then put it up to roast, basting it the
whole time with beef suet melted down, to which add hot water and salt. Serve up in a sitting
posture like a pig, and with a lime in the mouth.

136.--Potato Pie

Boil and mash down some potatoes, with pepper, salt, milk, and butter; line a pie-dish a quarter of
an inch thick with the mash; arrange in it a nicely-browned mutton, beef, or chicken stew, cover it
over with a thick coat of the mashed potatoes, and bake for a quarter of an hour.

137.--Minced Veal Potato Pie

Make a good rich veal mince, mixed with a little ham, and some sippets of bread-crumb cut into
small squares, diamonds, &c., and fried in butter; line the pie-dish with mashed potatoes as above
directed; fill into it the veal mince, with plenty of gravy; arrange the sippets, cover over with a thick
crust of the mashed potatoes, and bake for a quarter of an hour.

138.--Beef Steak and Pigeon Pie

This should consist of a slice of good steak, two pounds of beef, one chittack or two ounces of ghee,
a teaspoonful of salt, two fresh limes, four young pigeons, twelve oysters, twelve curry onions cut
lengthways into fine slices, a teaspoonful of ground pepper, some sweet herbs, and a dessertspoonful
of flour.

Cut up the steak into pieces three inches long, and two inches or two and a half wide, by half an
inch thick. Cut and divide each pigeon into four pieces; put up two pounds of beef with sufficient
water to make a good strong gravy, throwing in all the scraggy parts and other rejections of the steak
and pigeons. Warm the ghee, and fry in it the sliced onions; throw in, well dredged with the flour,
the steaks and pigeons, and after frying a while add the pepper, salt, soup herbs, and some of the
rind of the limes, and about half the beef gravy. Set the whole on a slow fire, and simmer until the
meat is tender; allow to cool; then add the oysters and the remaining gravy, with the juice of two
limes; put into a dish lined with pastry, cover over the whole with a pastry crust, and bake.

139.--Veal Pie

Cut a leg of veal into small pieces, or a breast into chops, and parboil in water enough to fill the
pie-dish. When about half stewed take the veal out; season the gravy with pepper, salt, a little mace,
and a little bacon; dredge in a little flour; line the sides of the dish with a pie-crust; arrange the meat,
pour in the gravy, cover it with a pie-crust, and bake it for an hour.

140.--Macaroni Pie

42 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

Take half a pound of macaroni (recipe No. 218); boil and throw away the first water; then boil it
again in some milk, and remove when it is quite tender. Prepare a strong gravy or soup with two
pounds of beef, well seasoned with ground white pepper, salt, and soup herbs.

Bruise into fine powder two ounces of some good English cheese; take a dessertspoonful of very dry
mustard, half a teaspoonful of very finely powdered white pepper, about two teaspoonfuls of salt,
and two chittacks or four ounces of butter. Pound very fine a couple of crisp biscuits.

Pour over the boiled macaroni sufficient beef gravy or stock to entirely cover it; then put in all the
pepper, salt, and mustard, but only half the ground cheese. Set it to simmer over a slow fire until the
gravy begins to dry, and the macaroni acquires some consistency. Then with three ounces of butter
(free of water) butter well the baking-dish; pour into it the macaroni; mix the remaining ground
cheese with the powered biscuit, and strew it over the pie; cut into small pieces the remaining ounce
of butter, and throw that also over the pie; then put the dish into an oven, and bake to a fine light but
rich brown colour. Ten to fifteen minutes' baking will be sufficient.

141.--Alderman's Mock Turtle Pie

Make an extra rich hash of a calf's head, cutting the pieces from the cheeks two and a half to three
inches long, and one and three-quarters to two inches wide. Slice the tongue, and cut into large-sized
shapes. Prepare brain cakes, and plenty of forcemeat and egg balls as per recipes Nos. 289 to 295.

Make an extra strong stock with eight calves' feet; season it highly with soup herbs, salt, and plenty
of ground black pepper; simmer until the meat begins to drop away from the bones; strain through a
coarse sieve, in order to get a very thick stock, passing as much of the dissolved meat through as
possible.

Line a deep pie-dish with a thick and rich pie-pastry, and arrange in it the hash, egg and meat balls,
and brain cakes, with some twenty or thirty green leaves of spinach, cut up to about the size and
shape of the meat. Pour over the whole as much stock as will fill the dish, cover over with pastry,
and bake.

142.--Sauce for Alderman's Mock Turtle Pie

Mix with some of the stock the contents of a canister of oysters well bruised, the pulp of sixteen or
twenty prunes, a blade of mace, some  nutmeg and cloves, a wineglassful of port wine, and a
tablespoonful   of   Worcestershire   sauce;   allow   to   simmer   for   ten   minutes,   and   add   it   to   the
ready-baked pie before it is put on the table.

143.--Friar Tuck's Mock Venison Pastry Pie

Take the chop ends of two large fat breasts of mutton; remove the bones, and after the meat has
been washed, cleaned, and dried, lard well with narrow slips of lean bacon and corned tongue; then
cut it up into twelve well-shaped chops nicely trimmed; steep them in the juice of onions, ginger,
and garlic in the proportion of one tablespoonful of the former to a dessertspoonful of the latter, and
half a teaspoonful of the last.

Make a strong broth or stock of the other side of the mutton, and all the rejections of bones, &c.;
season it well with pepper, salt, and soup herbs; remove the scum and cut away all the fat; then
strain through a sieve, rejecting all the fat, but passing through some of the lean; allow it to simmer
until it thickens, then add to it two blades of mace, half a dozen allspice, and as many small sticks of
cinnamon.

Line a deep metal pie-dish with the pastry pie-crust as per recipe No. 200, reserving sufficient for
the upper crust. Prepare a sausage roll, say six inches long, and two inches and a quarter thick, of
minced veal and udder, using the ordinary pie-crust pastry to inclose it in; then slice it into twelve
equal slices of the thickness of half an inch.

Remove the twelve chops out of the onion, garlic, and ginger juice; dredge them well with finely-

43 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

sifted flour mixed with pepper and salt; heat in a large deep frying-pan four tablespoonfuls of lard;
fry the chops of a light brown colour, and remove them carefully; then dredge with flour and slightly
brown the twelve slices of sausage, six of which lay at the bottom of the pie-dish; lay over them six
of the mutton chops; over the mutton chops place another layer of the sliced sausage roll, and over
that the remaining six chops; pour in as much of the stock or gravy as will fill the pie-dish, cover it
over with a layer of the pastry as per recipe No. 200, and bake carefully.

144.--Sauce for Friar Tuck's Mock Venison Pastry Pie

Put some of the stock or gravy into the pan in which the chops and sliced sausages had been
browned; add two tablespoonfuls of bruised and powdered oysters, and simmer from ten to fifteen
minutes. Serve hot, on the pie being cut, adding at the last moment a wineglassful of port wine and
one tablespoonful of lime-juice.

Make a hole in the centre of the pie through the crusts, and pour in the sauce with the help of a
lipped sauce-boat.

145.--Leg of Mutton Dumpling

Prepare a good pie-crust with one seer and a quarter of soojee, half a seer of flour, and half a seer of
suet, as per recipe No. 199.

Clean and trim the leg, cutting away the end of the knuckle-bone, and any other projections likely to
injure the dumpling. Sprinkle it well with ground pepper and some salt, and confine it securely in the
pastry, closing all joinings with the aid of a little water. Place the dumpling into a strong napkin,
previously buttered and dredged with flour; tie it securely, and allow it to boil from three to four
hours. Care must be taken that during the whole process of boiling the dumpling remains suspended
in the water, and not resting on the bottom of the pan. On removing it from the boiler, plunge it
immediately into a large tureen of cold water for two or three minutes. This will strengthen the
pastry and prevent its bursting or breaking while it is being served up.

146.--Sausage Rolls

Take equal portions of cold roast veal and ham, or cold fowl and tongue; chop them together very
small;  season with a  teaspoonful of powdered sweet herbs, and a spoonful of mixed salt and
cayenne pepper; mix well together. Put three tablespoonfuls of the meat well rolled together into
enough pastry (pie-crust recipe No. 199) to cover it. When you have used up the whole of your
materials, bake them for half an hour in a brisk oven. These rolls are excellent eating, either hot or
cold, and are especially adapted for travelling, gipsy, boating, or pic-nic parties.

147.--Dumpode Goose (Indian Way)

Take a good fat tender goose; feather, clean, and bone it carefully without destroying the skin; when
every bone has been removed, pour into the goose a mixture composed of a dessertspoonful each of
mustard, sweet oil, and mixed sauce.

Take all the bones and the giblet, the liver excepted, and make a good gravy seasoned with pepper,
salt, soup herbs, and bay-leaves. Mince very fine three pounds of beef, a quarter of a pound of beef
suet, a quarter of a pound of fat bacon, and the liver of the goose. Take of chopped garden herbs a
tablespoonful,  powdered  black  pepper   a  dessertspoonful,  mixed  hot  spices finely   powdered   a
dessertspoonful, finely-grated bread-crumbs two tablespoonfuls, salt a dessertspoonful, and essence
of anchovies, if liked, one teaspoonful. Mix the above well together, and stuff the goose.

Melt two chittacks and a half or five ounces of ghee; put in the goose, and pour over it the soup
made of the bones and giblet, and allow it to stew until quite tender; then glace the goose, as also
some boiled turnips, carrots, onions, and potatoes, and serve up hot, surrounded with the vegetables
and some English pickles.

148.--Dumpode Duck (Eastern Way)

44 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

Take a good fat duck; feather, clean, and bone it without hurting the skin; pour into it a mixture
made up of a teaspoonful each of mustard, sweet oil, and mixed sauce.

Make  a  gravy of the  bones and giblet, seasoning it  with pepper, salt, soup herbs, and  a  few
bay-leaves.

Mince together with the liver of the duck two pounds and a half of good beef, half a pound of beef
suet, a dessertspoonful of chopped garden herbs, a tablespoonful of grated bread-crumbs, half a
teaspoonful of mixed hot spices pounded, a teaspoonful each of black pepper and salt, and, for those
who like it, half a teaspoonful of essence of anchovies. Mix these well together, and stuff the duck.
Melt one chittack and a half or three ounces of ghee; put in the duck; pour over it the giblet gravy,
and allow it to cook until tender; then glace the duck, as also some ready-boiled mixed vegetables,
and serve up, surrounding the duck with the vegetables and some hot West-Indian pickle.

149.--Fowl a la Cardinal, or Dumpode Capon or Fowl

Feather the bird, clean it, and remove every bone very carefully without injuring the skin.

Make a good strong broth or gravy of the bone and giblet, reserving the liver.

Pour into the bird a mixture of sweet oil, mustard, and sauces in the proportion of one teaspoonful
of each.

Mince the liver together with one pound and a half of good beef, one pound and a half of beef suet,
a   dessertspoonful   each   of   finely-chopped   garden   herbs   and   finely-grated   bread-crumbs,   a
teaspoonful each of powdered mixed hot spices, finely-powdered black pepper, and salt, if liked,
and half a dozen oysters. Mix all well together, and stuff the bird; melt two chittacks or four ounces
of ghee, add to it the giblet gravy, cook and glace the bird in it, as also some vegetables, and serve
up hot, adding a little cayenne pepper to the gravy to make it piquant.

150.--Brisket of Beef Trambland

Heat or melt in a saucepan two chittacks of butter free of water; fry to a light brown a tablespoonful
of finely-sliced onions, then add a tablespoonful and a half of flour, which must be put in very
gradually, stirring the whole time; add half a teaspoonful of ground pepper, and one teaspoonful of
salt. When these have been well mixed, pour in gradually a large cupful of pure milk, and lastly two
wineglassfuls of vinegar. Keep stirring to prevent the sauce lumping. Mince fine half a dozen pickled
gherkins or French beans, and mince up also the yolks and whites of six hard-boiled eggs. Boil a
fresh brisket of beef, and dish up quite hot. Pour over it the sauce, over which sprinkle the minced
pickle, and then cover the whole with the minced eggs.

151.--Mutton Trambland

Is prepared, in all respects, as the above. The joint best adapted to "trambland" is a fore-quarter, or
only the shoulder, or the breast if required for a small party of two or three.

152.--Bubble and Squeak

Put into a pot cold meat cut into thin slices two inches square, with ready-boiled peas, cauliflower,
cabbage, potatoes, turnips, and carrots cut up, with pepper, salt, and sliced ginger, and with as much
good stock as will cover the meat and vegetables; allow the whole to simmer until the meat and
vegetables have absorbed half the stock, when it will be ready. Serve it up bubbling and squeaking.

153.--To Stew a Fillet of Veal

Bone, lard, and stuff a fillet of veal; half roast, and then stew it with two quarts of white stock, a
teaspoonful of lemon pickle, and one of mushroom catsup. Before serving, strain the gravy; thicken
it with butter rolled in flour; add a little cayenne, salt, and some pickled mushrooms; heat it, and
pour it over the veal. Have ready two or three dozens of forcemeat balls to put round it and upon the

top. Garnish with cut lemon.

154.--Veal Cutlets

Cut a neck of veal into cutlets, or take them off a leg. Season two well-beaten eggs with pounded
mace, nutmeg, salt, pepper, and finely-chopped sweet marjoram, lemon, thyme, and parsley; dip the
cutlets into it; sift over them grated bread, and fry them in clarified butter. Serve with a white sauce,
forcemeat balls, and small mushrooms. Garnish with fried parsley.

155.--Kidney Toasts

Pound, in a marble mortar, the kidney and the surrounding fat; season with pepper, salt, grated
lemon-peel, and nutmeg; mix with it the yolk of an egg well beaten; lay it upon thin toasted bread
cut into square bits; put a little butter into a dish, lay in it the kidney toasts, and brown them in an
oven. Serve them very hot.

156.--Rolled Mutton

Bone a shoulder of mutton carefully, so as not to injure the skin; cut all the meat from the skin,
mince it small, and season it highly with pepper, nutmeg, and a clove, some parsley, lemon, thyme,
sweet marjoram chopped, and a pounded onion, all well mixed, together with the well-beaten yolk
of an egg; roll it up very tightly in the skin; tie it round, and bake it in an oven for two or three
hours, according to the size of the mutton. Make a gravy of the bones and parings; season with an
onion, pepper, and salt; strain and thicken it with flour and butter; add a tablespoonful each of
vinegar, mushroom catsup, soy, and lemon pickle, and a  teacupful of  port wine; garnish with
forcemeat balls made of grated bread, and part of the mince.

157.--Haggis

Wash and clean the heart and lights; parboil and mince them very small; add one pound of minced
suet, two or three large onions minced, and two small handfuls of oatmeal; season highly with
pepper and salt, and mix all well together; the bag being perfectly clean and sweet, put in the
ingredients; press out the air, sew it up, and boil it for three hours.

158.--To Boil Marrow-bones

Saw them even at the bottom; butter and flour some bits of linen, and tie a piece over the top of
each bone; boil them for an hour or two, take off the linen, and serve them with thin slices of dry
toast cut into square bits. At table the marrow should be put upon the toast, and a little pepper and
salt sprinkled over it.

159.--Beef or Mutton Baked with Potatoes

Boil some potatoes; peel and pound them in a mortar with one or two small onions; moisten them
with milk and an egg beaten up; add a little salt and pepper. Season slices of beef or mutton chops
with salt and pepper, and more onion, if the flavour is approved; rub the bottom of a pudding-dish
with butter, and put in a layer of the mashed potatoes, which should be as thick as a batter, and then
a layer of meat, and so on alternately, till the dish is filled, ending with potatoes. Bake in an oven for
one hour.

160.--Olive Royals

Boil one pound of potatoes, and when nearly cold rub them perfectly smooth with four ounces of
flour and one ounce of butter; knead all together till it becomes a paste; roll it out about a quarter of
an inch thick, cut it into rounds, and lay upon one side any sort of cold roasted meat cut into thin
small bits, and seasoned with pepper and salt; put a small bit of butter over the meat; wet the edges
of the paste, and close it in the form of half-circles. Fry them in boiling fresh dripping till of a light
brown colour; lay them before the fire, on the back of a sieve, to drain. Serve them with or without
gravy in the dish. For a change, mince the meat, and season it as before directed. The potatoes

46 of 98

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

should be very mealy.

161.--To Boil Ox-Cheek

Wash half a head very clean; let it lie in cold water for some hours; break the bone in two, taking
care not to break the flesh; put it into a pot of boiling water, and let it boil from two to three hours;
take out the bone. Serve it with boiled carrots and turnips. The liquor in which the head has been
boiled may be strained, and made into barley broth.

162.--To Stew Ox-Cheek

Clean the head as before directed, and parboil it; take out the bone; stew it in part of the liquor in
which it was boiled, thickened with a piece of butter mixed with flour, and browned. Cut into dice,
or into any fancy shape, as many carrots and turnips as will fill a pint basin. Mince two or three
onions, add the vegetables, and season with salt and pepper. Cover the pan closely, and stew it two
hours. A little before serving, add a glassful of port wine.

163.--Dressed Ox-Cheek

Prepare it as directed for stewing; cut the meat into square pieces; make a sauce with a quart of
good gravy, thickened with butter mixed with flour; season with salt and pepper, a little cayenne,
and a tablespoonful of vinegar; put in the head, and simmer it till quite tender. A few minutes before
serving add a little catsup or white wine. Forcemeat balls may be added.

164.--Potted Ox-Cheek

May be made of the meat that is left from any one of the above dishes. It is cut into small bits, and
heated up with a little of the liquor in which the cheek was boiled, seasoned with pepper, salt,
nutmeg, and a little vinegar, then put into a mould, and turned out when required for use. It is used
for supper or luncheon, and is eaten with mustard and vinegar.

165.--Breasts of Mutton a la Ste. Menoult

Stew them with carrots, onions, and spices in gravy, and when done drain them and take out the
bones; flatten the meat between two dishes, and when cold cut it into the form of cutlets or hearts;
brush them with the beaten yolk of an egg; roll them in grated bread, then in clarified butter, and
again in the grated bread. Bake them in an oven till of a fine brown colour, and serve them with an
Italian or any other sauce.

166.--To Cure Mutton Ham

Cut a hind quarter of good mutton into the shape of a ham; pound one ounce of saltpetre, with one
pound of coarse salt and a quarter of a pound of brown sugar; rub the ham well with this mixture,
taking care to stuff the hole of the shank well with salt and sugar, and let it lie a fortnight, rubbing it
well with the pickle every two or three days; then take it out and press it with a weight for one day;
smoke it with sawdust for ten or fifteen days, or hang it to dry in the kitchen. If the ham is to be
boiled soon after it has been smoked, soak it one hour; and if it has been smoked any length of time,
it will require to be soaked several hours. Put it on in cold water and boil it gently for two hours. It is
eaten cold at breakfast, luncheon, or supper. A mutton ham is sometimes cured with the above
quantity of salt and sugar, with the addition of half an ounce of pepper, a quarter of an ounce of
cloves, and one nutmeg.

167.--Meat or Birds in Jelly

Clean the meat or the bird or birds; fully roast, bake, or stew in the usual way.

Place the meat in the mould, or if birds, arrange them with their breasts downwards; fill the mould
quite full with the jelly, recipe No. 329; set it to cool till the next day; then turn it on a dish, breasts
upwards. Garnish the dish with curled parsley, and some of the jelly cut fine, and sprinkled about.

If the jelly be clear, it will form a handsome side-dish for dinner or supper.

168.--Pigeons in Savoury Jelly

Bone six pigeons; remove the heads and feet, stuff with sausagemeat, and roast; lay the pigeons in a
mould with the breasts down; fill up the mould with jelly, recipe No. 329; and when cold, turn out.
Garnish with parsley, and some of the jelly cut fine, and sprinkled round the dish.

VEGETABLES

All vegetables should be boiled quickly, and, with the exception of spinach, in an open vessel,
skimming them carefully.

Herbs of all sorts should be gathered when in flower, and on a dry day, and, being well cleaned from
dust and dirt, tied up in small bunches and dried before the fire. They may then be kept in paper
bags labelled; or rubbed to a powder, sifted, and put into bottles and labelled.

169.--To Boil Potatoes

Wash and pare them, throwing them into cold water as they are pared; put them into a saucepan,
cover them with cold water, and throw in a little salt; cover the saucepan closely, and let them boil
quickly for half an hour; pour off the water immediately, and set the pan by the side of the fire to
dry the potatoes.

170.--Another Way

Wash them very clean, put them on in cold water, cover the saucepan, and let them boil quickly; as
soon as the water boils pour it off, and cover them with cold water; add a little salt, and when the

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

water boils pour it off instantly, when the potatoes will be sufficiently done; dry them, and take off
the skins before serving.

171.--To Broil Boiled Potatoes

After boiling potatoes not quite sufficiently to send to table, put them on a gridiron over a clear fire,
and turn them frequently till they are of a nice brown colour all over; serve them hot; take care they
do not become too hard, as that spoils the flavour.

172.--To Brown Potatoes under Meat while Roasting

After being boiled, lay them on a dish, and place it in the dripping-pan; baste them now and then
with a little of the meat dripping, and when one side is browned turn the other; they should all be of
an equal colour.

173.--Potato Ribbons

Wash four or five  large potatoes, scrape them, and cut them into thin strips round and round,
keeping as nearly to one width as possible; throw them into cold water as they are cut, and then fry
them of a light brown, in very hot or boiling beef dripping; strew over them a little salt and pepper,
and before serving, drain them upon a dish turned up before the fire.

174.--To Boil Turnips

Wash, pare, and throw them into cold water; put them on in boiling water with a little salt, and boil
them from two hours to two and a half; drain them in a colander, put them into a saucepan, and,
mixing in a bit of butter, with a beater mash them very smoothly; add half a pint of milk, mix it well
with the turnips, and make them quite hot before serving. If they are to be served plain, dish them as
soon as the water is drained off.

175.--To Dress Young Turnips

Wash, peel, and boil them till tender in water with a little salt; serve them with melted butter poured
over them. Or,

They may be stewed in a pint of milk thickened with a bit of butter rolled in flour, and seasoned with
salt and pepper, and served with the sauce.

176.--To Boil Spinach

Pick it very carefully, and wash it thoroughly two or three times in plenty of cold water; then put it
on in boiling water with a little salt; let it boil nearly twenty minutes; put it into a colander, hold it
under the water-cock, and let the water run on it for a minute; put it into a saucepan, beat it
perfectly smooth with a beater or wooden spoon, add a bit of butter and three tablespoonfuls of
cream, mix it well together, and make it hot before serving. When dished, it is scored in squares with
the back of a knife.

177.--Another Way

After being nicely picked and well washed, put it into a saucepan, with no more water than adheres
to it; add a little salt; cover the pan closely, and boil it till tender, frequently shaking it; beat it quite
smooth, adding butter and cream, and make it quite hot. Spinach may be served with poached eggs,
or fried sausages laid on it.

When the spinach is bitter, it is preferable to boil it in water.

178.--To Boil Cauliflowers

Trim them neatly, and let them lie an hour or two in cold water; then rinse them in fresh cold water,
and put them with a very little salt into boiling water; boil them twenty minutes, or half an hour if

49 of 98

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

very large. They may be boiled in milk and water, and require to be skimmed with particular
attention.

179.--To Boil French Beans

Cut off the stalk and string them; if not very young, cut them in four, or into very thin slices; put
them into water as they are done, and put them on in boiling water, with a little salt, and let them
boil for half an hour. If they are old they will require a longer time to boil. Melted butter in a sauce-
tureen is served with them.

180.--To Boil Asparagus

Wash them well, scrape, and tie them up in small bundles; cut them all even at the bottom, and as
they are done put them into cold water; put them on in boiling water, with a little salt, and let them
boil twenty or twenty-five minutes; take them up, lay them upon a slice of toasted bread cut in four,
and the crusts pared off, with the tops meeting in the middle of the dish, and cut off the strings.

181.--Asparagus a la Francais

Boil it, and chop small the heads and tender parts of the stalks, together with a boiled onion; add a
little salt and pepper, and the beaten yolk of an egg; heat it up. Serve it on sippets of toasted bread,
and pour over it a little melted batter.

182.--To Boil Brocoli

Wash it, cut off all the outside leaves and stalks, throw it into cold water as it is trimmed, put it on in
boiling water with a little salt, and boil it for twenty-five minutes or half an hour. It is sometimes
served upon bits of toasted bread, and a little melted butter poured round it.

183.--To Boil Artichokes

Cut off the stalks close to the bottom, wash them well, and let them lie for some hours in cold water;
put them on in boiling water with a little salt in it, cover the pan closely, and boil them an hour and a
half. If they are old, and have not been freshly gathered, they will take a longer time to boil. Melted
butter is served with them in a sauce-tureen.

184.--To Boil Young Green Cabbages

Wash and clean them well, put them on in boiling water with a little salt in it, and let them boil
quickly from three-quarters to nearly an hour. Serve with melted butter.

185.--To Stew Cucumbers

Pare eight or ten large cucumbers, and cut them into thick slices; flour them well, and fry them in
butter; then put them into a saucepan with a teacupful of gravy; season it highly with cayenne, salt,
mushroom catsup, and a little port wine. Let them stew for an hour, and serve them hot.

186.--Another Way

Pare the cucumbers, and let them lie in vinegar and water with a little salt in it; drain them, and put
them into a saucepan with a pint of gravy, a slice of lean ham, an onion stuck with one or two
cloves, and a bunch of parsley and thyme; let them stew, closely covered, till tender. Take out the
cucumbers, strain and thicken the gravy with a piece of butter rolled in flour, boil it up, and pour it
over the cucumbers.

187.--To Stew Mushrooms

Clean them as for pickling, and, after washing them, put them into a saucepan, with an anchovy, two
cloves, some nutmeg sliced, mace, whole pepper, and salt; let them stew in their own liquor till
tender.

50 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

In this way they will keep for some time, and when required to be dressed, pick out the spice, and to
a dishful put two large tablespoonfuls of white wine; add part of their own liquor, and let them just
boil; then stir in a bit of butter dredged with flour, and two tablespoonfuls of cream.

188.--Another Way

For a good-sized dishful, take a pint of white stock; season it with salt, pepper, and a little lemon
pickle; thicken it with a bit of butter rolled in flour; cleanse and peel the mushrooms, sprinkle them
with a very little salt, boil them for three or four minutes, put them into the gravy when it is hot, and
strew them for fifteen minutes.

189.--To Roast Onions

Roast them with the skins on in an oven, that they may brown equally. They are eaten with cold
fresh butter, pepper, and salt.

190.--Onions, Plain Boiled

Peel them, and let them lie an hour in cold water, put them on in boiling milk and water; boil them
till tender, and serve with melted butter poured over them.

191.--To Boil Carrots

Scrape, wash, and clean them; put them on in boiling water with some salt in it, and boil them from
two to three hours. Very young carrots will require one hour.

192.--Carrots, Flemish Way

Prepare (after boiling) in the  form of dice, balls, stars, crescents, &c., and stew with chopped
parsley, young onions, salt and pepper, in plain melted butter, or good brown gravy.

193.--Green Peas Stewed

Put a quart of good peas into a stewpan, with a lettuce and small onion sliced small, but not any
water; add a piece of butter the size of an orange, pepper and salt to taste, and stew gently for two
hours. Beat up an egg, and stir into them (or a lump of butter will do as well); mint should be stewed
(if it can be procured) with them, and ought to be chopped fine, and stirred in with some good gravy.

194.--To Boil Green Peas

After being shelled, wash them, drain them in a colander, put them on in plenty of boiling water,
with a teaspoonful of salt, and one of pounded loaf sugar; boil them till they become tender, which,
if young, will be in less than half an hour; if old, they will require more than an hour; drain them in a
colander, and put them immediately into a dish with a slice of fresh butter in it. Some people think it
an improvement to boil a small bunch of mint with the peas; it is then minced finely, and laid in
small heaps at the end or sides of the dish. If peas are allowed to stand in the water after being
boiled they lose their colour.

195.--To Stew Young Peas and Lettuce

Wash and make perfectly clean one or two heads of cabbage lettuce, pick off the outside leaves, and
lay them for two hours in cold water with a little salt in it; then slice them, and put them into a
saucepan, with a quart or three pints of peas, three tablespoonfuls of gravy, a bit of butter dredged
with flour, some pepper and salt, and a teaspoonful of pounded loaf sugar. Let them stew, closely
covered, till the peas are soft.

196.--Peas for a Second-course Dish, a la Francais

Put a quart of fine green peas, together with a bit of butter the size of a walnut, into as much warm
water as will cover them, in which let them stand for eight or ten minutes. Strain off the water, put

51 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

them into a saucepan, cover it, stir them frequently, and when a little tender add a bunch of parsley
and a young onion, nearly a dessertspoonful of loaf sugar, and an ounce of butter mixed with a
teaspoonful of flour; keep stirring them now and then till the peas be tender, and add, if they
become too thick, a tablespoonful of hot water. Before serving, take out the onion and bunch of
parsley.

197.--To Steam Peas

Shell and close-pack the peas securely in a large quantity of lettuce-salad leaves; put the package
into a stewpan over a moderate fire for the ordinary time required to boil peas, say half an hour,
when they will be ready.

198.--Vegetable Mash

Take boiled potatoes, cauliflower, carrots, turnips, and green peas; mash down the potatoes with
plenty of butter, pepper, and salt; mince small the cauliflower, carrots, and turnips, and add them
with the peas to the mashed potatoes; mix them all well together, and serve up hot.

PASTRY, PUDDINGS, SWEETMEATS, ETC.

199.--Pastry for Pies and Tarts

To every three ounces of flour take one ounce of soojee, two ounces of beef suet, and a little salt;
pick and clean the suet, pound it in a mortar, and make a flat circular cake of it; make a dough of the
flour and soojee, knead it well, divide it into two equal parts, and make them into two flat circular
cakes quite as large as the suet cake; roll the three together, placing the suet cake between the two
flour cakes; double the whole up twice, and roll it out again, when it will be ready for use.

200.--Pastry for Friar Tuck's Mock Venison Pastry Pie

Take of veal one pound, and of udder one pound; pick, clean, and wash them; chop, mince, and
pound them in a mortar; season with salt and white pepper; fix the mixture with the yolk and white
of an egg well beaten up; pass it through a sieve, rejecting all that will not pass; and form it into a
flat circular cake.

Make a dough of two pounds and a half of flour and half a pound of soojee; add a little salt, and

52 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

knead it well; then form two cakes of the dough; place the veal and udder cake between, and roll
out the three very carefully; double up the whole and roll it out again, when it will be ready.

The pie-dish should be lined thickly with the pastry, and, although a single layer should cover the
top of the pie, the sides and edges of the dish should be built up high with it; a double layer of the
crust is not interdicted to cover the top of the pie if it will not interfere with raising it up.

201.--Custard

Take a seer of milk and a stick of cinnamon, and boil down to half the quantity; add sugar to taste;
beat up quickly the yolks of four eggs, and add them gradually to the milk, stirring it continually;
after a while thicken with a tablespoonful of rice flour; take it off the fire, and flavour with rose
water, orange-flower water, or vanilla.

202.--Orange Custard

Boil very tender the rind of half an orange, and beat it in a mortar until it is very fine; put it to a
spoonful of the best brandy, the juice of an orange, four ounces of loaf sugar, and the yolk of four
eggs; beat them altogether for ten minutes, and then pour in by degrees a pint of boiling milk; beat
them until cold; then put them in custard-cups into a dish of hot water; let them stand till they are
set; then take them out, and stick preserved orange-peel on the top. This forms a fine-flavoured dish,
and may be served up hot or cold.

203.--Chocolate Custard

Rasp three ounces of fine Spanish chocolate, which has the vanilla flavour; make a paste of it with
the smallest possible quantity of water; put two pints of pure milk over the fire, and let it boil; then
add powdered loaf sugar to your taste, and a little salt; meanwhile, beat up the chocolate with some
of the milk as it boils, and mix it well; pour it into the boiling milk, which you must keep in motion;
add the yolks of eight eggs well beaten up; keep stirring in, or rather milling the mixture, until of
sufficient consistency; when cool enough put the custards into glasses.

204.--Almond Custard

Blanch  and pound,  with two  tablespoonfuls of   orange-flower  water,  a   quarter  of  a   pound  of
almonds; add rather more than a pint of milk, thickened with a teaspoonful of corn-flour, and the
well-beaten-up yolks of six eggs; sweeten to taste with pounded loaf sugar, and stir it over a slow
fire till it thickens, but do not allow it to boil. Serve up in glass custard-cups.

205.--Princess Royal Custard

Beat up in a  large deep bowl the yolks of eight fresh eggs; dredge  into it while beating up a
dessertspoonful of corn-flour; sweeten to taste with the best pounded loaf sugar; add to it a quarter
of a pound of Jordan almonds well bruised in a marble mortar; pour the mixture into a clean newly-
tinned copper pan; stir into it a seer of good cold milk; have a brisk flaming fire ready. Put the pan
on the fire; never cease stirring it, keeping the spoon as much as possible in the centre of the pan;
reduce the flame after it has boiled for fifteen minutes, and continue to boil for a few minutes
longer, until the custard is of the consistency required.

206.--Rose-bloom Custard

This  is  made   in   every   respect   like   the   foregoing,   adding  some   bruised   almonds,   and   a   little
rose-bloom to tint the custard. The froth of the white of the eggs is also tinted with a few drops of
the rose-bloom.

207.--Blanc Mange

Boil, till dissolved, three-fourths of an ounce of isinglass in as much water as will cover it; when
lukewarm, add to it gradually a quart of good rich milk, with a stick of cinnamon, some lemon-peel,

53 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

and a few bitter almonds well pounded; sweeten to taste; boil for five or six minutes, stirring it all
the while; strain through muslin into moulds, and place in a pan of cold water to congeal.

208.--Another Way

Blanch and pound with a little rose-water two ounces of sweet and six bitter almonds; dissolve
three-fourths of an ounce of isinglass in a little water; when nearly cool, mix it into a quart of good
rich milk; mix in the almonds the peel of a small lemon and a stick of cinnamon; sweeten to taste
with good clean sugar; let it stand for two or three hours; then put it into a pan, and let it boil for six
or eight minutes, stirring it constantly; strain through muslin, and keep stirring it until nearly cold;
then pour it into moulds.

209.--Rice Blanc Mange

Mix to a stiff smooth paste four tablespoonfuls of finely-sifted ground rice-flour, with a little cold
milk; then stir it into a quart of boiling milk, in which had been dissolved one-eighth of an ounce of
isinglass, a stick of cinnamon, and the peel of half a small lemon; sweeten to taste; boil it from ten to
fifteen minutes, stirring it carefully all the while; remove it from the fire, and mix into it briskly a
tablespoonful of pounded almonds, and pour it while scalding hot into moulds previously dipped in
cold water.

N.B.--If it be desired to tint it in streaks like marble, drop into the mould every here and there, at the
time of pouring the blanc mange, some of the cochineal, recipe No. 268.

210.--Corn-flour Blanc Mange

The above recipe will answer, except that the quantity of corn-flour must be in the proportion of two
tablespoonfuls to every quart of milk.

211.--Christmas Plum Pudding (Indian Way)

This pudding may be made a few days before it is required for the table.

Take of cleaned and picked raisins one pound and a half, currants half a pound, finely-grated bread-
crumbs three-quarters of a pound, finely-sliced mixed peel half a pound, finely-minced suet three-
quarters of a pound, and sugar three-quarters of a pound. Mix all these well together with half a
teaspoonful of finely-powdered mixed spices, say cinnamon, nutmeg, and mace; then moisten the
mixture with half a pound of butter free of water, twelve eggs well beaten, and a wineglassful of
brandy, stirring it well the whole time, that the ingredients may be thoroughly mixed.

Butter a large piece of cloth or napkin; dredge it well with flour; put the mixture into it, and tie it
down tightly; after boiling it steadily for seven hours take it out of the boiler and hang it up
immediately, until the day it is intended to be eaten, when it should be boiled again for fully two
hours, care being taken that the water is boiling before the pudding is put into it. Then turn it out of
the towel, and serve up with brandy sauce.

212.--Bombay Pudding

Take two pounds or one seer of soojee, half roast it, then boil it in water until it becomes very thick;
butter a soup-plate or any other dish of about the same depth; pour the boiled soojee into it; when it
has cooled and congealed, cut it into eight or more cakes; rub the cakes over with the yolk of an
egg, dredge with finely-sifted flour, and fry in ghee until they acquire a rich brown colour. Arrange
them in a dish, and pour over them a thick syrup flavoured with lemon-juice.

213.--Another Way

Make a good sweet custard and set it aside; rasp fine a cocoanut, and fry it in a little butter with
grated nutmeg; pour into it gradually a  wineglassful of brandy, stirring it all the  time; have  a
pudding-dish lined with a good puff paste; pour the fried cocoanut gradually into the custard, stirring

54 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

it well all the while; fill the pudding-dish with the mixture, and bake it in a gentle oven for fifteen to
twenty minutes, or until the pudding is cooked.

214.--Cocoanut Rice Pudding

Soak a breakfastcupful of fine rice in water until quite soft; scoop out the contents of a hard
cocoanut; extract all the milk with a little boiling-hot water, then boil the rice in it, sweeten it to
taste with some date jagree or treacle, and put in a few grains of aniseed. Pour the mixture into a
buttered pudding-dish and bake it slightly.

215.--Indian Lemon Pudding

Take four chittacks or eight ounces of butter free of water, six chittacks or twelve ounces of white
sugar, twelve fresh eggs, four wineglassfuls of lemon or lime juice, and four tablespoonfuls of finely-
grated bread-crumbs. Mix the butter and the sugar, add the yolks of the eggs, then the lime-juice and
bread-crumbs, and when the oven is ready add the whites of the eggs well beaten up, put the whole
into a buttered pudding-dish, and bake it immediately.

216.--Marmalade Pudding

This pudding requires care in mixing the ingredients thoroughly together, but it proves so excellent
when eaten, either cold or hot, that it fully repays the trouble of preparation. Shred six ounces of
fresh beef suet, and chop it up fine; mix it with two ounces of moist sugar, a quarter of a pound of
well-grated bread-crumbs, and then stir in half a pint of new milk; when these are all mixed, add the
well-beaten yolks of three eggs, whisk all together for a quarter of an hour, and set it to stand on a
cold stone for an hour. Butter a pudding-dish or mould thickly, place a layer of the above mixture in
it, then a layer of marmalade, another layer of mixture, and so on alternately until the mixture is
exhausted. For the above quantity about one pound of marmalade will be required. Whisk the
whites of the eggs with a little loaf sugar and orange-flower water, place the froth at the top of the
pudding, and bake for an hour and a half in a moderate oven.

217.--Custard Pudding

Mix with a pint of cream or milk six well-beaten eggs, two tablespoonfuls of finely-sifted flour, half
a small nutmeg grated, or an equal quantity of pounded cinnamon, a tablespoonful of pounded loaf
sugar, and a little salt; put it into a cloth or buttered basin, that will exactly hold it, and boil it for half
an hour. Serve with wine sauce.

218.--Macaroni

Take the yolks and white of two fresh eggs, and as much finely-sifted flour (English or American
preferable to country) as will make a good dough of the consistency of dough for pie-crusts without
the addition of any water; roll it out to its full extent on a large board to about the thickness of an
eight-anna piece; then cut it up into small squares, diamonds, or circles, or into any shape or design
you please, which must be done quickly, as within an hour of its being rolled out the pastry will
harden. It may be used immediately, or in the winter it may be kept good for a few days.

N.B.--If pipe macaroni be required, cut the macaroni in ribbons of the required width, dredge some
flour over it, and put it lengthways over glass pipes, joining the two cut ends with the aid of a little
raw egg, and draw the pipes out as the pastry hardens round them. For pipe macaroni, the pastry
should be rolled finer.

219.--Tart and Pie Crusts of Soojee

To one seer and a quarter of soojee add half a seer of suet and a teaspoonful of salt. Thoroughly
clean the suet, remove all the skin and other objectionable particles, chop, mince, and pound fine in
a mortar. Damp the soojee for half an hour before kneading it, then knead it with the suet and a little
of the yeast, recipe No. 283; divide it into parts, dredge it with flour, and roll in layers; repeat the
operation two or three times, and the pastry when baked will be light and flaky. Half a seer of flour

55 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

will be required for dredging and rolling.

220.--Chappatee or Hand-Bread

The native hand-bread is made simply of wheat-flour and water; the addition of a little salt would be
an improvement. Make a good dough of flour and water, take a piece about the size of an egg, roll it
out to the circumference of a half-plate, and bake it over an iron or earthen plate.

221.--Dalpooree

Prepare a dal chur churree, recipe No. 93; put it into a marble mortar, and reduce it to a fine paste.
Prepare an ordinary pie pastry; take two pieces of the prepared dough, each of the size of a walnut;
shape them into two small bowls; take as much of the dal paste as will make a ball the size of a
walnut; put it into one of the bowls of dough, and cover it over with the other bowl, and then roll out
the whole very carefully to the size of a dinner-plate, and fry in ghee of a very light yellow colour.
The lighter and thinner dalpoorees can be made the better. They should be eaten hot.

222.--Dal Pittas

Prepare an ordinary pie-crust, and the dal chur churree, recipe No. 93; roll out the pastry, cut into
circles of the size of saucers, put into them a tablespoonful of the dal, and close them; fry in ghee of
a light brown colour. They should be eaten hot.

223.--Prawn Doopiaja Pittas

The same as the above, enclosing in the pastry a tablespoonful of the prawn doopiaja, recipe No. 69;
fry in ghee.

224.--Prawn Doopiaja Loaf

Pare away very finely all the outer brown crust of the bread, without injuring the inner crust; cut out
of the top of the loaf a small square sufficiently large to extract from within all the crumb, leaving
the shell complete; then fill the loaf up to the top either with some prawn doopiaja minced, or with
the prawn cofta curry, No. 37, and as much gravy as it will take; replace the square bit at the top,
bake it to a light brown, and serve up hot.

225.--Fowl Doopiaja Loaf

Is made in the same way as the prawn loaf, the difference being that the shell of the bread is stuffed
with either a fowl doopiaja, recipe No. 23, or with the chicken cofta curry, recipe No. 34; all the
bones of the fowl will require to be removed before the bread is stuffed with the curry.

226.--Falooree

Take of the finely-sifted flour of the chunna ka dal, which has been previously parched, one seer; six
large   Patna   onions   finely   sliced   and   chopped;   eight   fresh   green   chilies   sliced   very   fine;   a
tablespoonful each of finely-chopped soa mattee, saug, and parsley; a dessertspoonful of salt and a
teaspoonful of finely-ground green ginger. Put the seer of dal-flour into a large deep pan, and mix
into it all the above condiments; then keep adding to it water, very gradually and in small quantities
at a time, mixing it briskly the whole while, until it is of a consistency that if poured on a plate from
a spoon it will incline to a pyramid, or if dropped into a glass of water will not readily dissolve, but
drop to the bottom en masse. In this state the mixture will be ready to fry.

Take half a seer of the best mustard oil; put it into a deep frying-pan with some fine slices of
lemon-peel, and fry it or cook it thoroughly; remove three-fourths of the cooked oil from the
frying-pan, and into the  remainder, while  boiling and bubbling, with a  tablespoon pour in the
preparation in the shape of rocks, and allow to brown, turning them over so that top and bottom may
be  of the same colour. As the oil is being expended clear the  pan of all particles which may
accumulate, pour in some more of the ready-cooked oil, and continue to fry until all the mixture is

fried. They should be eaten hot.

227.--Cocoanut Pittas

Scrape finely a cocoanut, brown it with some jagree and a few grains of the black cardamom seed,
and set it aside; then prepare a pastry of finely-sifted rice-flour (it must be kneaded with boiling-hot
water, and will not roll out); take as much as the size of a duck's egg, and press it out flat in the palm
of your hand to the size of a large saucer; put a tablespoonful of the fried cocoanut into it, and close
it up in a half-moon shape, with the help of a little water. Have a wide-mouthed large earthen pot of
boiling water; stretch and tie over its mouth a napkin, and steam the pittas or cakes over them; they
will be ready in half an hour, and may be eaten hot or cold.

228.--Plantain Fritters

Prepare a batter of twelve ripe plantains, four tablespoonfuls of finely-sifted flour, half a cupful of
milk, sugar to taste, and cardamom and caraway seeds, with a couple of eggs beaten up; mix the
whole well together, and make into small cakes by pouring a tablespoonful at a time of the mixture
into melted ghee; fry them on both sides to a good brown colour, and serve up hot.

229.--Fried Plantains

Slice or divide very ripe plantains lengthways into two; brush them slightly with the yolk of an egg;
dredge with flour, and fry in melted ghee. Serve up hot, sprinkled with crushed crystallized sugar.

230.--Bibinca Dosee, or Portuguese Cocoanut Pudding

Extract a cupful of milk from two cocoanuts, and set it aside. Make a syrup of three-quarters of a
pound of sugar; mix into the syrup half a pound of rice-flour finely sifted, and the cocoanut milk,
which boil over a  good fire, stirring the  whole  while until it thickens;  pour it into a buttered
pudding-dish, and bake it of a rich light-brown colour.

231.--Bole Comadree, or Portuguese Cocoanut Pudding with Jagree

Extract a cupful of milk from two cocoanuts, and set it aside. Make a syrup of half a pound of sugar;
mix into it half a pound of finely-sifted rice-flour, and set aside; fry with the yolk of an egg all the
scrapings of the two cocoanuts, half a pound of jagree, and some grains of aniseed; then mix the
whole thoroughly together, and after the oven is well heated, and ready to receive the pudding, pour
the mixture into a well-buttered pudding dish, and bake over a slow fire until it is perfectly set.

232.--Goolgoola, or Fritters

Take half a seer or one pound each of flour, sugar, and milk, half a dozen small sticks of cinnamon, a
little yeast, and half a seer of ghee; mix the flour with the yeast and a little milk; add water sufficient
to bring it to a thick consistency; then put into it gradually the sugar and the remainder of the milk,
and place it on the fire, adding the cinnamon; keep stirring it with a large spoon until it is again
reduced to a thick consistency; remove it from the fire, and when it has cooled make it up into small
balls, and fry them in ghee.

233.--Another Way (as usually served on the tea-table)

Take two chittacks or four ounces of soojee, four eggs well beaten up and four chittacks or eight
ounces of milk; mix the soojee and eggs, beating them well together, and gradually add the milk.
Melt down three chittacks or six ounces of ghee in a small but deep pan; pour into the boiling ghee
in one spot the mixture, a dessertspoonful at a time, and fry until of a rich brown colour. Serve up
hot, sprinkled with crushed crystallized sugar.

234.--Cajure

Mix one seer of soojee with four tablespoonfuls of ghee; add half a seer of sugar; mix well together;
then pour in gradually a quarter of a seer of milk, and last of all as much flour as will make a good

57 of 98

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

dough; let it be well kneaded, and then allowed to stand for two or three hours.

Have some ghee melted; take the dough of the size of walnuts, shape them like shells and fry them
in the melted ghee until they acquire a rich brown colour.

235.--Hulluah

Steep half a seer of soojee in one seer of water for twelve hours, or, if the hulluah be made in the
winter, let it soak for eighteen hours; it will then be the "milk of soojee," which strain through a
coarse duster, rejecting only such impurities as remain unstrained; add to the milk half a seer of
sugar, and boil it, stirring it all the time, and as it thickens add three chittacks or six ounces of ghee,
warmed with a few white cardamoms and a few small sticks of cinnamon; continue stirring it from
first to last until the whole is well mixed together, and the hulluah finally taken out of the pan; while
warm put it into shapes or moulds.

236.--Another Way

Take half a seer of soojee, ghee, sugar, almonds, and raisins, and a few white cardamoms and sticks
of cinnamon. Make a syrup of the sugar, and set it aside. Roast the soojee, or brown it, and set it
aside. Melt the ghee, and fry the soojee with the spices in it, after which put in the almonds and
raisins, stirring it well all the time; last of all add the syrup, and continue to cook and stir it until it
thickens; then remove into moulds or shapes while hot.

237.--A Two-pound or One-seer Plum Cake

This is the favourite cake for Christmas, weddings, birthdays, and christenings in India, and consists
of the following ingredients:--
  Butter, perfectly free of water                   4 lb or 2 seers
  Good clean sugar                                  2 "  or 1  "
  Raisins, cleaned, stoned, and dried               2 "  or 1  "
  Currants, cleaned, stoned, picked, and dried      2 "  or 1  "
  Jordon almonds, blanched and sliced very fine     2 "  or 1  "
  Preserved ginger     -+                     -+
      "     citron      |   All cut into small |
      "     orange-peel +-  pieces and well    +-   2 "  or 1  "
      "     lemon-peel  |   dried, mixed       |
      "     pumpkin    -+                     -+
  Cinnamon, finely pounded and sifted               1 Tablespoonful
  Nutmegs, finely grated                            1/2     "
  Dried orange-peel, finely pounded and sifted      1/2     "
  English caraway-seeds, cleaned and picked         2       "
  Mace, finely pounded and sifted                   1/2     "
  Finely-sifted flour                               1 1/2 lb or 3/4 seer
  Soojee                                            1/2 lb or 1/4 seer
  Eggs, new or fresh laid                           40
  Brandy of the best quality                        1 claret-glass

An experienced man ought to be engaged to mix the ingredients, which, if properly done, will take
fully one hour.

Have two large glazed earthen preserving-pans; put the sugar into one, and bruise it well down,
breaking all the lumps; add to it three pounds and three-quarters of butter; then throw in one by one
all the yolks of the forty eggs, and throw the whites into the other preserving-pan, mixing the sugar,
butter, and the yolks the whole while briskly and without ceasing. While one man is mixing these
ingredients another ought to be actively employed in beating up the whites of the eggs unceasingly
for nearly an hour.

After the butter has been well mixed with the sugar and eggs, dredge in all the finely-pounded spices
and the caraway-seeds; after a while dredge in the flour and soojee in small quantities at a time (this
must be well mixed); the currants, raisins, and preserves, with the almonds, are next to be added. By
this time the man will have been engaged in mixing the ingredients fully three-quarters of an hour.

58 of 98

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

After the raisins, &c., have been thoroughly mixed, pour in the brandy very gradually, and in small
quantities at a time, and last of all add the well-beaten whites of the forty eggs: the stirring now must
be very brisk to effect a perfect mixture of the whites of the eggs right through; fill quickly into the
moulds, and bake without a moment's delay in a brisk baker's oven.

N.B.--The moulds ought to be lined with paper and well buttered.

238.--Swiss Cakes

Take butter, flour, and sugar, of each the weight of four eggs; beat the yolks with the sugar and some
grated lemon-peel, or ten drops of essence of lemon, and one large teaspoonful of rose-water, or
orange-flower water if preferred; add the butter just melted, and slowly shake in the flour, beating it
until well mixed; beat the whites of the eggs to a froth, mix the whole together, and beat on for a
few minutes after the whites are added. Butter a tin, and bake the cake half an hour.

239.--Queen Cakes

Prepare eight ounces of fresh butter beaten to a cream, six ounces of pounded and sifted loaf sugar,
half a  pound of dried and sifted flour, the  same  quantity of cleaned and dried currants, four
well-beaten eggs, a little grated nutmeg and pounded cinnamon, and a few pounded bitter almonds;
then add the sugar to the butter, put in the eggs by degrees, after that the flour and the other
ingredients; beat all well together for half an hour, and put it into small buttered tins, nearly filling
them, and strew over the top finely-powdered loaf sugar. Bake them in a pretty brisk oven.

240.--Shrewsbury Cakes

Mix with half a pound of fresh butter, washed in rose-water and beaten to a cream, the same
quantity of dried and sifted flour, seven ounces of pounded and sifted loaf sugar, half an ounce of
caraway-seeds, and two well-beaten eggs; make them into a paste, roll it thin, cut it into round
cakes, prick them, and bake them upon floured tins.

241.--Another Way

Rub into a pound of dried and sifted flour half a pound of fresh butter, seven ounces of sifted loaf
sugar, the same quantity of cleaned and dried currants, and a little grated nutmeg; make it into a
paste with a little water and two tablespoonfuls of rose or orange-flower water; roll it out, and cut it
into round cakes; prick them, and bake them upon tins dusted with flour.

242.--Shortbread

For two pounds of sifted flour, allow one pound of butter, a quarter of a pound of candied orange
and lemon-peel, a quarter of a pound each of pounded loaf sugar, blanched sweet almonds, and
caraway comfits; cut the lemon, the orange-peel, and almonds into small thin bits, and mix them
with a pound and a half of the flour, a few of the caraway comfits, and the sugar; melt the butter,
and when cool, pour it into the flour, at the same time mixing it quickly with the hands; form it into a
large round nearly an inch thick, using the remainder of the flour to make it up with; cut it into four,
and with the finger and thumb pinch each bit nearly all round the edge; prick them with a fork, and
strew the rest of the caraway comfits over the top. Put the pieces upon white paper dusted with
flour, and then upon tins. Bake them in a moderate oven.

243.--Scotch Shortbread

Warm before the fire two pounds of flour and one pound of butter free of water; rub the butter, with
twelve ounces of sugar, into the flour with the hand and make it into a stiff paste with four eggs, well
beaten; the rolling-out to the required thickness must be done with as little use of the rolling-pin as
possible; either take small pieces, and roll them into oblong cakes, or roll out a large piece and cut it
into squares or rounds; prick a pattern round the edge of each cake with the back of a knife, and
arrange slices of candied peel, caraway-seeds, and caraway comfits in a pattern. They will take
about twenty minutes to bake, and the oven itself should not be too quick. The mixing of flour,

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

sugar, and butter, and afterwards of the eggs, must be done very thoroughly and smoothly.

244.--Another Way

Take two pounds of flour, one pound of butter, four eggs, and twelve ounces of loaf sugar powdered
very finely; rub the butter and sugar into the flour with the hand, and by means of the eggs convert
it into a stiff paste; roll it out half an inch thick, and cut into square or round cakes; pinch up the
edges to the height of about an inch, and on the top of each cake place some slices of candied peel
and some large caraway comfits, pressed down so as to imbed about half of each in the cake. Bake
in a warm oven upon iron plates.

245.--Gingerbread Nuts

Take three pounds of flour, a pound of sugar, three pounds and a half of treacle, half an ounce of
caraway-seeds, half an ounce of allspice, two ounces of butter, half an ounce of candied lemon-peel,
three ounces of ground ginger, half an ounce of coriander, the yolks of three eggs, and a wineglassful
of brandy; work the butter to a cream, then the eggs, spice, and brandy, then flour, sugar, and then
hot treacle; if not stiff enough, a little more flour must be added in rolling out, but the less the better.

246.--Another Way

Take two pounds of flour, one pound and a quarter of treacle, half a pound of sugar, two ounces of
ginger, three-quarters of a pound of butter (melted), and a small quantity of cayenne pepper; mix all
together and roll out to about the thickness of half an inch, or not quite so much; cut into cakes, and
bake in a moderate oven.

247.--Ginger Cakes

In two pounds of flour well mix three-quarters of a pound of good moist sugar and one ounce of the
best Jamaica ginger; have ready three-quarters of a pound of lard melted, and four eggs well beaten;
mix the lard and eggs together and stir into the flour, which will form a paste; roll out into thin cakes
and bake in a moderately heated oven.

Lemon biscuits may be made the same way, substituting essence of lemon instead of ginger.

248.--Gingerbread Spiced

Take  three-quarters of  a  pound of treacle, one  egg, four  ounces of  moist sugar, an ounce  of
powdered ginger, a quarter of an ounce each of mace, cloves, allspice, and nutmeg powdered, a
pound of oiled butter, and sufficient flour to make a stiff paste; mix well, and make into thick pieces,
which should be brushed over the top with white of egg and baked for an hour in a moderate oven.

249.--American Gingerbread

Take half a pound of fresh butter melted, a pound and a half of dried and sifted flour, the same
quantity of brown sugar, a quarter of a pound of pounded ginger, nine eggs, the yolks and whites
separately beaten, one glass of rose-water, and one of white wine; mix all well together, and beat for
an hour; then with a spoon spread it over flat tin pans, about the thickness of a penny-piece; bake it
of a light brown, and while warm cut it into oblong pieces, and place them on end till cool, when
they will be very crisp.

250.--Rich Gingerbread Cakes

To one pound of dried and sifted flour allow half a pound of pounded loaf sugar, three-quarters of a
pound of fresh butter washed in rose-water, one pound of treacle, one nutmeg grated, the weight of
a nutmeg of pounded mace, and as much of pounded cinnamon, one ounce of pounded ginger, one
and a half of candied orange and lemon-peel cut small, half an ounce of blanched sweet almonds cut
into long thin bits, and two well-beaten eggs. Melt the butter with the treacle, and when nearly cold
stir in the eggs and the rest of the ingredients; mix all well together, make it into round cakes, and

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

bake them upon tins.

251.--Indian Gingerbread

Take twelve ounces of pounded loaf sugar, a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, one pound of dried
flour, two ounces of pounded ginger, and a quarter of an ounce each of cloves and cinnamon. Mix
the ginger and the spice with the flour; put the sugar and a small teacupful of water into a saucepan;
when it is dissolved add the butter, and as soon as it is melted mix it with the flour and other things;
work it up, form the paste into cakes or nuts, and bake them upon tins.

252.--Oatmeal Gingerbread

Gingerbread made with oatmeal instead of flour, besides being nice, is a very useful aperient for
children.

253.--Excellent Cheesecakes, known at Richmond as "Maids of Honour"

Take half a pound of curd free from the whey; add to it six ounces of butter, four yolks of eggs, and
sugar and nutmeg to the taste; mix all the ingredients well; line patty-pans with a puff paste, fill
them with the mixture, and bake in a quick oven. The cheesecakes may be flavoured with lemon for
a variety, and, as a further variety, currants and raisins may be introduced.

254.--Cocoanut Cheesecakes

Grate a good-sized nut very fine, and add to it four or five spoonfuls of rich syrup and one spoonful
of rose-water; set it over a few coals, and keep stirring till it is mixed; then take it off the fire and let
it cool; next mix the  yolks of two eggs well with it, and bake  in small paps in the shape of
cheesecakes. The pastry for the pans must be made with flour and yokes of eggs, rolled as thin as
possible; wet the tops of the cakes with rose-water; sift some refined sugar over them, and bake
them in an oven at a gentle heat.

255.--Buns

Mix together one pound of flour, six ounces of butter, two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, a quarter
of a pound of sugar, one egg, nearly a quarter of a pint of milk, and a few drops of essence of lemon.
Bake immediately. The above quantities will make twenty-four buns; for variety, currants or raisins
may be added.

256.--Rout Cakes

To one pound of ground almonds add one pound of powdered sugar; mix them together with yolks
of eggs to a stiff, yet flexible paste; then form it into small biscuits in the shape of coronets, shells,
filberts, birds' nest, rings, or any other fancy shapes; let them remain five or six hours, or all night,
upon the baking-tin in a warm oven.

257.--French Pancakes

Beat separately the yolks and whites of seven eggs; beat with the yolks four tablespoonfuls of
pounded loaf sugar, the same quantity of flour, one pint of cream or milk, the grated peel and juice
of one lemon, and two tablespoonfuls of rose-water; add the beaten whites the last thing. Allow
three tablespoonfuls to each pancake.

258.--Common Pancakes

With nearly half a pound of flour mix five well-beaten eggs, and then add, by degrees, a quart of
good milk; fry them in fresh lard, and serve them with pounded loaf sugar strewed between each.

259.--Indian Pancakes

Add to three well-beaten eggs a pint of new milk, three tablespoonfuls of flour, some sugar, and a

61 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

little pounded cinnamon; mix all well together, and fry in butter; brown the upper side for a minute
before the fire; serve it, cut into four, with pounded sugar strewed over it.

260.--Pink Pancakes

These are rarely seen at an English table, although they form a very pleasing variety. Boil a large red
beetroot until it is very tender; then peel it, cut it into thin slices, pound it to a pulp in a marble
mortar, and strain through muslin; add the yolks of five eggs, two tablespoonfuls of flour, four of
cream, plenty of pounded loaf sugar, half a nutmeg grated, and a wineglassful of brandy; rub the
whole into a batter, and fry the pancakes with melted butter, ghee, or lard; serve them up hot,
garnished with green candied sweetmeats.

261.--Mango Fool

Take six green mangoes; remove every particle of the green peel, cut them into four, and steep them
in clean water; throw the stones away; boil the fruit perfectly tender, pulp and pass it through a
sieve, sweeten to your taste, and add to it very gradually, stirring all the while, as much good pure
milk as will reduce it to the consistency of custard. It should be eaten on the day it is made.

262.--Another Way

Boil to a pulp some green mangoes without peel or stones; pass through a sieve, and sweeten to
taste; then mix into it very gradually some cold milk, which has been previously boiled; keep stirring
until it has acquired the thickness of an ordinary cream custard; fill into glass cups, and grate a little
cinnamon or nutmeg over them.

263.--Pink Mango Fool

The pink mango fool is produced by the introduction of beetroot boiled very tender, bruised down,
strained through muslin, and added to the pulp of the mango, and forms an agreeable variety.

264.--Vanilla Drops

Take the whites of four eggs, beat them up well, and add three-quarters of a pound of finely-
powdered white sugar; flavour with vanilla, beat up well, and drop it on buttered paper. Bake in a
cool oven.

265.--Mincemeat

Ingredients:--Three large lemons, three large apples, one pound of stoned raisins, one pound of
currants, one pound of suet, two pounds of moist sugar, one pound of sliced candied orange-peel,
one ounce of sliced candied citron, the same quantity of lemon-peel, one teacupful of brandy, and
two tablespoonfuls of orange marmalade.

Grate the rinds of the lemons, squeeze out the juice, strain it, and boil the remainder of the lemons
until tender enough to pulp or chop very finely; then add to this pulp the apples, which should be
baked, and their skins and cores removed; put in the remaining ingredients one by one, and as they
are added mix everything thoroughly together. Put the mincemeat into a stone jar with a closely-
fitting lid, and in a fortnight it will be ready for use. This should be made the first or second week in
December.

266.--Another Way

Take seven pounds of currants well picked and cleaned; of finely shopped suet beef, the lean of
sirloin of beef minced raw, and citron, lemon, and orange peel cut small, each half a pound; two
pounds of fine moist sugar, an ounce of mixed spice, and the rinds of four lemons and four oranges;
mix well, and put in a deep pan. Mix a bottle of brandy and white wine and the juice of the four
lemons and oranges; pour half over, and press down tight with the hand; then add the other half and
cover closely. It may be made one year, to use the next.

267.--Ornaments for Custards or Creams

Whisk for an hour the whites of two eggs, together with two tablespoonfuls of some syrup or thin
jelly; lay it in any form upon a custard or cream, piled up to imitate rock, or it may be served in a
dish with cream round it. The  ornament may be  coloured, if desired, with cochineal, saffron,
spinach, &c., as directed in the following recipe.

268.--Colouring for Jellies, Creams, Ices, and Cakes

Boil very slowly in a gill of water, till reduced to one half, twenty grains of cochineal, and the same
quantity of alum and cream of tartar finely pounded; strain, and keep it in a small phial.

For yellow, use an infusion of saffron.

For green, wash well, and pull into small bits, a handful of spinach-leaves; put them into a closely-
covered saucepan, let them boil for a few minutes, and then press the juice.

269.--Colouring Mixtures

Yellow.--Into a four-ounce phial put half a drachm of saffron and two ounces of spirits of wine of
the strength of sixty-two degrees over proof. Let it stand until the spirit is tinted of a deep yellow;
then strain it for use.

Red.--This is produced by infusing during a fortnight two ounces of red sandal-wood in a pint of
spirits of wine. It at the expiration of that time the colour should not be dark enough, a pinch of
subcarbonate of soda will give it the required tint.

Pink.--Dissolve half an ounce of cochineal in a sufficient quantity of spirits of wine.

Green.--Put a handful of well-cleansed vine-leaves or spinach into a decanter, fill with spirits of
wine, and let it stand in the sun for ten or twelve days; strain when the wine has become of a bright
green.

N.B.--The above colouring matters are only adapted for tinting liqueurs, wines, lemonades, and
essences.

270.--Frost or Icing for Cakes

Beat till very light the whites of four eggs, and add gradually three quarters of a pound of double-
refined sugar, pounded and sifted through a lawn sieve; mix in the juice of half a lemon; beat it till
very light and white; place the cake before the fire, pour over it the icing, and smooth over the top
and sides with the back of a spoon.

271.--Another Way

Beat to a stiff froth the whites of three new-laid eggs, and add to them one pound of sifted white
sugar; flour the cake, and then wipe it off; apply the icing by means of a knife smoothly; then bake
in a slow oven.

272.--Coloured Icings

Pink icing should be made by adding cochineal syrup; blue, with indigo; yellow, with saffron or
gamboge; green, with spinach syrup or sap green; brown, with chocolate.

273.--Fine Icing for Tarts and Puffs

Pound and sift four ounces of refined loaf sugar; beat up the white of an egg, and by degrees add it
to the sugar till it looks white and is thick. When the tarts are baked, lay the icing over the top with a
brush or feather, and then return them to the oven to harden, but take care that they do not become
brown.

274.--Raspberry Iced Cream

Mix a tablespoonful of pounded loaf sugar, two tablespoonfuls of raspberry jelly or jam, and a little
cochineal   to   heighten   the   colour,   with   the   juice   of   a   large   lemon;   strain,   and   put   into   the
freezing-pot; cover it closely and place it in a bucket which has a small hole near the bottom, and a
spigot to let the water run off, with plenty of ice broken small, and mixed with three or four handfuls
of coarse salt; press the ice closely round the freezing-pot, turn it round and round for about ten
minutes, take off the cover, and remove with a spoon the frozen cream to the centre; cover it again,
and turn it till all be equally iced. Serve it in china ice-pails in block, or put it into moulds, cover
them securely, and replace them in the bucket, with ice and salt as before, for an hour or more; dip
the moulds into cold water before turning out, and serve immediately. Water ices are made in this
way, substituting water for cream.

275.--Apricot Iced Cream

Mix a tablespoonful of pounded loaf sugar with two of apricot jam, the juice of a lemon, and half an
ounce of blanched bitter almonds pounded with a little rose-water; add a pint of cream, stir all well
together before putting it into the freezing-pot, and freeze it as directed above.

276.--Mille Fruit Iced Cream

Strain the juice of three lemons, and grate the peel of one; mince finely a dessertspoonful each of
orange marmalade, dried cherries, and preserved angelica; add to these half a pint of syrup, and mix
the whole with a pint and a half of cream, or a pint of water, and then drop in here and there a few
drops of the prepared cochineal. Put it into a mould, and freeze as above directed.

277.--Orange-water Iced

Mix with a pint of water the strained juice of three oranges and one lemon, also the grated peel of
one orange; sweeten it well with syrup, and freeze it.

278.--Juice of Fruit Iced

Press through a sieve the juice of a pint of currants or raspberries, or other fruit preserved for tarts;
add to it four or five ounces of pounded loaf sugar, a little lemon-juice, and a pint of cream. It may
be whisked previous to freezing, and a mixture of the juice in which the fruit was preserved may be
used.

279.--Orange Iced Cream

Boil down a seer and a half of milk to half the quantity with some isinglass and a quarter of a seer or
half a pound of sugar; strain through a sieve, and when perfectly cool add the juice of twelve
oranges. Mix well, put into freezing-pots with two seers or four pounds of raw rice and some salt,
and freeze as above.

280.--Bael Sherbet

Take a perfectly ripe sweet bael, and scoop out the whole contents into a bowl; make a paste of it
with a little water; then add sugar to taste, and as much water as will bring it to the consistency of
good honey; then pass it through a fine sieve, leaving all the fibres and seeds behind; it is a most
delicious drink, and if taken early in the morning in rather a liquid state--say of the consistency of
porter--serves as a  most effective  aperient in a  natural and healthy form; but if taken of the
consistency of thick pea or potato soup, it has a directly contrary effect, and as such is invaluable in
all cases of relaxed bowels.

281.--Mallie, or Cream as prepared by the Natives

Boil down over a slow fire milk to less than half its original quantity, and when cold it will be of the
strength and consistency of a well-made blanc mange.

N.B.--The best Indian sweetmeats are made of mallie.

282.--Tyre or Dhye

Warm some milk without boiling it; stir into it a little stale butter about the size of a large pea; put
the vessel in a warm place well covered over, and in the course of eight or ten hours the tyre will be
ready.

283.--Yeast

Boil one pound of good flour, a quarter of a pound of brown sugar, and a little salt in two gallons of
water for one hour; when milk-warm, bottle it close; it will be fit to use in twenty-four hours. One
pint of this will make eighteen pounds of bread.

284.--Another Way

Take two pounds of soojee or flour, a quarter of a pound of brown sugar or suckur, and half a
drachm of hops. Dry the hops in the sun, and then reduce them to fine powder, by pounding in a
mortar. Mix the soojee or flour and powdered hops with a little water, just sufficient to make a stiff
dough; then add the sugar and knead all well together. Roll the leaven into a ball, wrap it lightly in a
clean cloth, then in a blanket, and put it away for three days, when it will be ready for use.

N.B.--If worked up or kneaded once daily during the three days, the fermentation will be more
perfect.

The above quantity will be sufficient for twenty-five pounds weight of bread.

BOILED MEATS, MADE DISHES, PUDDINGS, ETC.

285.--Casserole of Potatoes

Peel and boil some good mealy potatoes, pound them, and mix with them some butter, cream, and a
little salt; put them about an inch and a half high upon a dish, and leave an opening in the centre;
bake it of a light brown colour, and take out as much more from the centre as will admit of a ragout,
fricassee cutlet, or macaroni being put in.

286.--Rissoles or Croquets

Mince very finely some cold roast meat or fowl and a small bit of bacon; season it with grated
nutmeg and salt; moisten it with cream, and make it up into good-sized balls; dip them into yolks of
eggs beaten up, and then into finely-grated bread. Bake them in an oven, or fry of a light brown
colour. Before serving, drain them before a fire on the back of a sieve. Garnish with fried parsley.

287.--Fricandellans

Mince about two pounds of tender lean beef and three-quarters of a pound of fresh suet; then pound
till it is as smooth as a paste, and carefully pick out all the threads and sinews; add four well-beaten
eggs, half a pint of rich cream, and as much grated and sifted bread as will make it sufficiently
consistent to form into rolls resembling corks; and season with salt and pepper. Boil the corks in
some good stock, or in boiling water, or fry them.

288.--Forcemeat

Mince very finely the following ingredients:--Three ounces of fresh beef suet, one of fat bacon,
three of raw or dressed veal, two of grated bread, a little grated lemon-eel, nutmeg, pepper, salt, and
finely-minced parsley; mix all well together, and bind with the beaten yolks of eggs; make it into
croquets or balls, the size of large nutmegs, and fry them in ghee or clarified beef dripping, or use it
for stuffing.

289.--Forcemeat balls

May be made of pounded veal or mutton, minced beef suet or fat of veal, taking an equal quantity
of meat, suet, and grated bread-crumbs; add a bit of fat bacon chopped, season with salt, pepper,
and grated nutmeg, and mix all well together with the beaten yolk of an egg.

290.--Another Way

To half a pound of beef or veal add half a pound of udder; mince and pound to a pulp in a mortar;
remove all gristle and parts not pulped, and mix with it the finely-grated crumbs of a slice of stale
bread, and a tablespoonful of finely-chopped parsley; soften down the whole with some milk or
gravy, then add a teaspoonful of finely-pounded pepper and a teaspoonful of salt; rub down the
whole well together, and add the whites and yolks of two raw eggs, well beaten up; make into balls.
If for soup, the size of the balls should be that of small nutmegs; if to garnish made dishes, make
them into the size of large walnuts or of ordinary croquets or rissoles.

291.--Forcemeat Onions

Peel four or five large onions, scoop out the inside, fill them with forcemeat, and roast them in an
oven.

They may be served with roast turkey or fowl.

292.--Forcemeat for Fish

Pick from the bones the meat of a large beckty, hilsa, or any sort of white fish; mince it finely, and
add the same proportions of minced suet and grated bread, a few chopped oysters, and some boiled
parsley chopped; season with a little pounded onion, cayenne pepper, salt, nutmeg, and lemon-peel;
mix all well together, and bind it with the well-beaten yolks of eggs; roll it into small balls, and fry
them.

293.--Egg Balls

Grind down to a powder or paste the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs; add a teaspoonful of very finely
sifted flour, some tender leaves of parsley, finely chopped, and a little white pepper and salt; grind,

294.--Brain Cakes

Having previously boiled down the brains, bruise them, and add a teaspoonful of finely-sifted flour,
some grated nutmeg, pepper, and salt, and a raw egg; then roll out like piecrust to the thickness of a
rupee, punch out cakes of the size of Spanish dollars, and fry them.

295.--Another Way

Take the brains and remove any veins, &c.; chop well with a knife, add salt, nutmeg, and pepper, a
little raw egg, and flour enough to make them stick together; mix well, make into cakes about the
size of the top of liqueur glasses, and fry them brown on both sides.

296.--Sauce for Salads

Bruise   down  when   quite   cold   the   yolks  of   four   hard-boiled  eggs,   and   rub  into   them  half   a
teaspoonful of pepper, one of salt and one tablespoonful of sugar, with two to three tablespoonfuls
of prepared mustard. When well rubbed together, add very gradually four tablespoonfuls of oil,
stirring   it   the   whole   while;   when   well   mixed   add   a   dessertspoonful   of   Lee   and   Perrin's
Worcestershire sauce, one tablespoonful and a half of white wine vinegar, and a dessertspoonful of
tarragon vinegar.

If the sauce be required thicker than usual, take either a larger number of eggs or a teaspoonful or a
dessertspoonful of corn or other flour; put  it into a  cup, pour over it the  quantity  of vinegar
prescribed above, place the cup in a saucepan of boiling water over the fire, and stir until the
vinegar thickens to the desired consistency; then mix it gradually into the preparation of eggs, oil,
&c.

297.--Sauce for Lobster Salad

Observe all the directions given in the foregoing recipe, adding to the yolks of the hard-boiled eggs
some of the spawn or red coral of the lobsters and a dash of essence of anchovy. Omit the sugar, and
instead of the Worcestershire sauce substitute mushroom catsup and Indian tapp sauce.

298.--Excellent Fish Sauce

Wash and bone two anchovies, and rub them up in a mortar with a quarter of a pound of butter and
half a teaspoonful of flour. Put these into a small saucepan; then add to the yolks of three eggs well
beaten up, two tablespoonfuls of tarragon vinegar, a small bunch of sweet herbs, consisting of
parsley, green onions, and a bay-leaf, and a little salt, pepper, and nutmeg; stir these over the fire
until the sauce is thick, but be careful not to let it boil, or it will burn. Serve it up in a sauce-tureen.

299.--Sauce for Boiled Mutton or Boiled Brisket of Beef

Warm a saucepan, and melt in it two chittacks or four ounces of butter free of water; fry in it a
tablespoonful of finely-sliced onions; when half browned, put in gradually two tablespoonfuls of
finely-sifted flour, taking care to keep stirring it the whole time; then add gradually eight chittacks or
sixteen ounces of pure  milk, and lastly two wineglasses of vinegar, with finely-pounded white
pepper and salt to taste. This sauce is without its equal.

300.--Fresh Tomato Gravy Sauce for Made Dishes

Take forty tomatoes (halved), some soup herbs, and salt; boil them in a little stock; strain through a
sieve, replace on the fire, and thicken with the addition, more or less, of a dessertspoonful of
arrowroot or corn or other flour, to obtain any required consistency; finally add a teaspoonful of
good English vinegar; if a sharper gravy sauce be required, instead of the vinegar add either a
dessertspoonful of tapp sauce or a teaspoonful of chili vinegar.

301.--Tapp Sauce Gravy for Made Dishes

Thicken a good seasoned stock with arrowroot or corn-flour; add to every cup of the thickened

other made dishes.

302.--Sauce for Cucumber Salad

Slice into a soup-plate two large Patna onions and a couple of fresh chilies; sprinkle over with
ground pepper and a little salt; then add two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and allow to stand for two or
three hours before adding to it the sliced cucumbers. This sauce is also used occasionally for lobster
and prawn salads.

303.--Parsley Sauce

Pick,  clean,  and   mince   fine   some   fresh  green  crisp  parsley,  and  put  it  into  a   tureen   with   a
tablespoonful of chopped capers and a teaspoonful of good English vinegar. Fry to a nice light
brown a dessertspoonful of curry onions in two chittacks or four ounces of butter, free of water; add
a cup of good white stock, free of fat, and thicken with crumb of stale bread finely grated, a
teaspoonful of salt, and a little pepper; allow to simmer until of a sufficient consistency; then pour it
over the minced parsley and capers, mix well together, and it is ready for use.

304.--Onion Sauce

Clean and boil six or eight good Patna onions; allow the water to drain away; fry to a light brown
colour, in two chittacks or four ounces of butter, free of water, a dessertspoonful of finely-sliced
curry onions; then gradually mix into it a tablespoonful of finely-sifted flour and half a seer of milk,
taking care through the whole operation to keep stirring the sauce to prevent its lumping; add a
teaspoonful of salt and a quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper; last of all add the boiled onions, and in
a few minutes the sauce will be ready.

305.--White Onion Sauce

Peel and cut in halves eight large and perfectly sound white Patna onions, and steep them in water
for half an hour; then boil them until quite tender; drain them of all water; then chop and bruise
them fine, and put them into a  saucepan, with half a  chittack or one  ounce  of  butter,  half a
teaspoonful of salt, and some milk; put the mixture over a brisk fire, and keep stirring till it boils;
then rub the whole through a sieve, after which add sufficient milk to make the  sauce of the
consistency required. This is a favourite sauce for boiled mutton, over which some occasionally
strew a tablespoonful of capers.

306.--Brown Onion Sauce for Gravy

Heat one chittack or two ounces of butter, free of water, in which fry to a light brown half a dozen
well-selected white Patna onions finely sliced; then stir into it gradually half a chittack or one ounce
of flour; add a little stock and some pepper and salt, boil up for a few minutes, strain through a
sieve, and then add a tablespoonful of port wine, and the same of mushroom catsup. Lemon-juice or
vinegar may be added if a sharper gravy be required.

307.--Sauce for Boiled Beef

Mince a large onion, parboil it, and drain off the water; put the onion into a saucepan, with a
tablespoonful of finely-chopped parsley, some good gravy, and one ounce of butter dredged with a
little flour; let it boil nearly ten minutes, and add a spoonful of cut capers. The sauce must be
thoroughly heated before being served up.

allow it to boil.

310.--Oyster Sauce

a little lemon-juice, and add three tablespoonfuls of cream. Heat it well, but do not let it boil.

311.--Sauce for Roast Beef

Mix well together a large tablespoonful of finely-grated horseradish, a dessertspoonful of made
mustard, and half a dessertspoonful of brown sugar; then add vinegar till it be as thick as made

312.--To make a Quart Bottle of Fish or Meat Sauce

To half a bottle of vinegar put one ounce of cayenne, two cloves of garlic, one tablespoonful of soy,
two of walnut, and two of mushroom catsup. Let it stand six days, shaking it frequently; then add

day; run it through a flannel bag, and put it into half-pint bottles.

314.--Bread Sauce

Boil in a pint of water the crumb of a French roll or of a slice of bread, a minced onion, and some
whole pepper; when the onion is tender drain off the water, pick out the peppercorns, and rub the

sugar; make it quite hot, and serve in a sauce-tureen, with grated nutmeg on the top.

320.--Parsley and Butter

Pick and wash clean a large bunch of parsley, tie it up, and boil it for a few minutes in water; drain
and chop it very finely, add some melted butter, and make it quite hot. It is better to be made thick
with parsley.

321.--Melted Butter

Dust a little flour over a quarter of a pound of butter, and put it into a saucepan, with about a
wineglass of water; stir it one way constantly till it is melted, and let it just boil: a round wooden
stick is the best thing to stir batter with in melting. If the butter is to be melted with cream, use the
same proportion as of water, but no flour; stir it constantly, and heat it thoroughly, but do not let it
boil.

322.--French Melted Butter

Mix in a stewpan, with a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, a tablespoonful of flour, a little salt, half
a gill of water, half a spoonful of white vinegar, and a little grated nutmeg. Put it on the fire, stir it,

bacon chopped, and a bit of butter the size of a walnut. Season with pepper, salt, nutmeg, chopped
lemon thyme, and parsley; bind with an egg beaten.

324.--Stuffing peculiar for Fowls only

Take four boiled potatoes; break them into pieces while hot, and add a chittack or two ounces of
butter free of water, some pepper and salt, a little grated bread-crumb, and some eight or ten olives
stoned, and cut or chopped small; the quantity of potatoes and bread-crumb may be increased or
decreased according to the size of the fowl or number of fowls to be stuffed; moisten with a little
stock or gravy before stuffing the fowls.

325.--Stuffing for Roast Pig, Roast Kid, Fillets of Veal, and Duck

Break up, but not mash, six boiled potatoes with one chittack or two ounces of butter free from
water; cut into fine slices two white Patna onions, take a little finely-chopped suet, finely-grated
crumbs of a slice of stale bread, a teaspoonful of ground pepper, a teaspoonful of salt, all kinds of
soup herbs, and a dessertspoonful of tomato or tapp sauce, add a little of the stock or gravy of the

N.B.--The liver may be cut up or minced, and added to the stuffing.

326.--Stuffing for Boiled Turkey, Goose, or Duck

Mince a quarter of a pound of beef suet, and grate fine the crumbs of a thick slice of stale bread;
add a good quantity of soup herbs, finely sliced and chopped Patna onions, lemon-peel, some grated
nutmeg, a teaspoonful of white pepper, a teaspoonful of salt, half a dozen oysters, and an anchovy,
or in the absence of anchovies a little minced ham or tongue; melt down one chittack or two ounces
of butter; then throw in the above ingredients and warm up well; moisten with stock, and then stuff
the bird.

327.--Stuffing for Roast Duck

Slice into fine long strips or ribbons as much of the heart or inside of a young tender cabbage as will
suffice for stuffing; wash and dry it through a colander, and shake it up in a napkin, without crushing

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

or destroying the crispness of the leaves; take for the stuffing as much only as will suffice to stuff
the number of ducks intended to be dressed; add for each duck a teaspoonful of finely-pounded
pepper, and one of salt, with three cloves of garlic, and two chittacks or four ounces of butter free of
water; stuff your birds and bake or roast as you please.

328.--Stuffing for Roast Turkey or Goose

Break, blanch, and slice up very fine twenty-five Barcelona nuts and a dozen Jordan almonds, and
set aside; fry, in two chittacks or four ounces of butter free of water, four tablespoonfuls of finely-
sliced onions; add to it one dozen oysters, half a dozen boiled potatoes broken up small, but not
mashed, a pork or beef sausage broken up small, the rind of a fresh lemon finely sliced and chopped,
the crumb of a slice of stale bread grated fine, some garden herbs, grated nutmeg, plenty of finely-
pounded pepper, and salt to taste; then add the sliced nuts, and as much stock as will cover the
whole of the mixture, and allow it to simmer over a slow fire until it is reduced to the consistency of
stuffing; next add the juice of a lemon and a little mushroom catsup and port wine, and stuff the
bird, after fixing the stuffing with an egg.

329.--Jelly for Cooked Birds, Meats, or Made Dishes

Boil down eight calves'-feet, with some pepper and salt, two onions, a head of celery, and two
carrots, in three or four quarts of water, according to the quantity of jelly required; when perfectly
boiled down strain it lightly without bruising the onions or carrots; let it cool, and remove all the fat;
then, with a dozen cloves and the juice and rind of a lemon, boil it again, adding a tablespoonful of
soy or any other dark-coloured, rich, and well-flavoured sauce; beat up to a light froth the whites of
four eggs, and clear the soup or jelly; add a wineglass of brown sherry, and run or drip it through
flannel. Pour what you require over the ready cooked or dressed meat into moulds, and let the rest
cool in some large flat dish, and cut it up small for garnishing the meat or bird when served up.

Steep the tamarinds for twelve hours in a quart of the vinegar; strain them through a sieve, rejecting
the stones, and add the other two quarts of vinegar, all the ground condiments, and salt; break the
tomatoes into the mixture, and boil the whole, stirring it all the time until it thickens; remove it from
the fire, and when cold strain it carefully and bottle the liquid, which is the sauce.

331.--Tomato or Love-apple Chutnee

Ingredients:--Two hundred large ripe love-apples, four ounces of raisins, seven ounces of salt, four
ounces of sugar, eight ounces of chilies, finely sliced, four ounces of ground garlic, and seven

pound of sugar, two pounds of salt, a quart of lime-juice, and six quarts of vinegar.

Mix all the above well together, put it into stone jars, and expose it to the sun for twenty days or a
month, after which drain away the liquid, which is the sauce; boil it for ten to fifteen minutes, and
when cold bottle and cork it.

333.--Sweet Chutnee

The refuse of the tapp sauce makes an excellent chutnee with the addition of some thick syrup, a
few dried dates, a few more whole raisins, and some hot spices. Put the whole into a pan and let it
simmer for a quarter of an hour, or until the syrup is absorbed and the chutnee reduced to a proper
consistency; when cool, bottle, and cork it well down.

334.--Another Way

Ingredients:--Two hundred green mangoes, peeled and sliced, four pounds of salt, three pounds of
ground garlic, three pounds of ground ginger, one pound of chilies, finely sliced, four pounds of
raisins, half a dozen bay-leaves, eight pounds of sugar, and four quarts of vinegar.

Make all the sugar into a syrup with two quarts of the vinegar, in which the sliced mangoes must be
boiled; when half done, throw in the other ingredients, and mix up well; last of all, add the remaining
two quarts of vinegar, and when the chutnee begins to thicken remove it from the fire; let it cool,
and then bottle it.

335.--Sweet Mango Chutnee

Ingredients:--A hundred green mangoes, peeled and sliced, two seers of tamarinds stoned, the syrup
of  six pounds of sugar  boiled in three  quarts of  vinegar, one  tablespoonful of finely-pounded
cinnamon, two pounds of salt, two pounds of sliced ginger, two pounds of cleaned and picked
raisins, three quarts of vinegar, and one dessertspoonful of grated nutmeg.

preserving-pan, mix in all the condiments and other ingredients, and allow the whole to simmer for
half an hour, pouring in the syrup gradually, and mixing all the time, until the vinegar and syrup have
been   absorbed,  and  the  chutnee   has  acquired   the  desired  consistency;   bottle   and  cork  when
perfectly cold.

vinegar,  four  pounds  of   tamarinds,  stoned   and   strained,  three   quarts  of   vinegar,  eight   or  ten
bay-leaves, one pound of green chilies, two pounds of sliced ginger, one pound of cloves of garlic,
one pound of raisins, and two pounds of salt.

Peel and cut the mangoes into fine slices, and steep them in salt for twenty-four to thirty-six hours;
remove the mangoes from the salt water, and boil them in three quarts of vinegar; when quite cool,
lay them in  a  preserving-pan, sprinkle  over  them  the  remaining salt,  add  all the   condiments,
tamarinds, raisins, &c., and allow the whole to simmer for half an hour, stirring all the time, with the
syrup. It should not be bottled until quite cold.

337.--Tamarind Chutnee

chilies, ginger, and garlic, two ounces of ground cinnamon, half a pound of picked currants, half a
pound of raisins (the small Cabool are the best), two pounds of soft sugar, a quarter of a pound of
salt, and a quart of vinegar.

Put the whole into a glazed earthen preserving-pan, pour over it a quart of vinegar or syrup, or as
much as will entirely cover the mixture, and mix all well together; then allow it to simmer over a
quick   fire   until  the   vinegar   or   syrup   is  absorbed   and   the   chutnee   thickened   to   the   required
consistency; it must be stirred during the whole time it is on the fire.

N.B.--The two pounds of sugar and the quart of vinegar may be made into syrup or used separately.

338.--Cussoondee

Peel and slice fine a hundred green mangoes, steep them in salt for twelve hours, then put them
under a heavy pressure for two hours, and drain away all the water; then mix with them half a
pound each of ground chilies, ginger, and garlic, half a pound of bruised mustard-seed, two pounds
of tamarinds without the stones, and some salt; when the whole is thoroughly mixed, pour over it as
much warmed or cooked mustard oil as will entirely cover it, and cook it for ten to fifteen minutes
over a brisk fire; when cold bottle it, taking care that it is kept several inches well under the oil, and
that it is well corked, or it will spoil.

339.--Mango Amchoor

Peel and quarter some green mangoes; sprinkle with salt, and expose them to the sun until they
begin to dry up; then rub them with dry pounded turmeric, chilies, and dry ginger; sprinkle more
salt, and expose them to the sun again, until they are quite dried up, when they may be bottled and
kept for use.

340.--Pickled Cabbage

Quarter a full-sized cabbage, keep it in salt for forty-eight hours, and then drain away all the water.
Prepare a pickle or brine of salt and water in the proportion of eight ounces of salt to twenty-four
ounces of water, and boil it with half an ounce each of peppercorns and bay-leaves; pack the
cabbage loose in a wide-mouthed stone jar, and pour over it the cold pickle or brine, which should
have been boiled the day before. Care must be taken to keep the mouth of the jar always airtight, or
the cabbage will rot. When required for use, take out as much as will be required, steep it in fresh
cold water for an hour or two, and then boil it the same as fresh cabbage.

341.--Red Cabbage Pickle

Slice  the cabbage, and sprinkle  salt over each layer; after twenty-four hours remove  it into a
colander, and allow all the salt water to drain; then put the cabbage into a pan, pour in sufficient
boiling vinegar to cover it, and add a few slices of red beetroot; when cold, put it into glass bottles
and cork down.

342.--Red Cauliflower Pickle

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

This is a very uncommon pickle, and looks particularly pretty in white bottles. Cut the cauliflower
into pieces of equal sizes, sprinkle with salt, and place it in the sun for a couple of days. Make a
syrup of vinegar and sugar: to every quart of vinegar put a quarter of a pound of sugar, a few sticks
of cinnamon, and as much sliced or bruised and pounded red beet as will give the vinegar a deep red
colour. When all the salt water has drained away, put the cauliflower into a pan, and pour over it the
boiling-hot vinegar or syrup through a fine sieve, in order to leave behind the sticks of cinnamon and
fibres of the beetroot; when cold, put the pickle into nice white bottles and cork.

343.--Patna or Bombay Onion Pickle

According to the size and number of bottles, take the small or button onions; remove the outer coat,
wash and dry them thoroughly, throw them into a pan with some vinegar, and parboil them; set the
vinegar aside, after filtering it, for shrimp, cucumber, and other salads, or for the preparation of
mustard. Put the parboiled onions when cold into wide-mouthed bottles, laying them alternately with
fresh red chilies, a few black peppercorns, some finely-sliced green ginger, and a little salt. Fill the
bottles with vinegar, and cork them.

344.--Mangoes Pickled Whole

Peel and divide some large-sized mangoes sufficiently to admit of the stones being easily extracted;
rub them over with salt, and expose them to the sun for two or three days; then dry them with a
napkin, and stuff each mango with a few cloves of garlic, finely-sliced chilies and ginger, some
cullungee seeds, a clove or two, and a stick or two of cinnamon; tie them securely with strong
sewing cotton, and put them into bottles, with vinegar sufficient to cover them; cork the bottles well,
and expose them to the sun for fifteen to twenty days. The pickle will be ready for use in three or
four months.

To prevent the pickle spoiling, it is not unusual to pour a tablespoonful or two of mustard oil over it
when in the bottle.

345.--Sweet Mango Pickle

Peel and quarter a hundred green mangoes, and steep them in salt for thirty-six hours; drain off the
salt water, wipe the mangoes dry, and put them into a preserving-pan, with a seer or two pounds of
sliced ginger, and half a seer of chilies finely sliced; pour in a syrup made of sugar and vinegar (half
a seer of the former in two quarts of the latter), and allow the whole to simmer for ten to fifteen
minutes; bottle when quite cold.

346.--Long Plum Pickle

Take the long plums, or what the natives call nar kollee bhyar; remove the peel, and keep them in
salt in the sun for a day or two; drain away the salt water, and put them into bottles, in layers
alternately with fresh chilies, cloves of garlic, ginger finely sliced, and peppercorns; add a little more
salt, and pour in as much vinegar as will cover the whole; cork and expose to the sun for fifteen to
twenty days. This is one of the most delicious of Indian pickles; it will not be fit for use until the
plums have pickled for six months.

347.--Sweet Long Plum Pickle

Is made in every respect according to the foregoing recipe, with the addition of a syrup in the
proportion of a quarter of a pound of sugar to every quart of vinegar, and a few sticks of cinnamon.

348.--Round Plum Pickle

Get the perfectly ripe fruit, which the natives call cool; put them into a damp cloth, and roll them
about to free them of dust; sprinkle them well with salt, and stand them in the sun for three or four
days; then drain away all the water, and bottle the plums alternately with cloves of garlic, green or
fresh red chilies, sliced ginger, peppercorns, and ground mustard-seed; add a little salt, fill up the
bottles with vinegar, and cork, and expose them to the sun for fifteen to twenty days.

349.--Round Plum Pickle with Mustard Oil

Is made like the above, the only difference being that some mustard oil is poured over the vinegar,
and allowed to float about an eighth of an inch thick over the surface.

350.--Dry Fruit Pickle

This is the pickle of all pickles. Take equal quantities of "dry dates," called the shawarah, khobanee,
or Arabian apricots; allobhokara, a species of Arabian plum or damson; English prunes, rather of
the dry sort; and Normandy dry pippins. Wash and clean them thoroughly, particularly the Arabian
dry fruits, which are very dirty, and dry them well in the sun. Stew the dry dates for ten to fifteen
minutes, cut them up into rings, and throw away the stones. Make a syrup of good French vinegar, in
the proportion of a quarter of a pound of good clean sugar to a quart of French vinegar. After
quartering the pippins, arrange them and the other fruit in a wide-mouthed bottle in alternate layers,
with finely-sliced ginger, peppercorns, sticks of cinnamon, and small sprinklings of salt; then pour
over the whole as much of the vinegar syrup as will entirely cover the fruit; cork the bottle well
down, expose it to the sun for a few days, and it will be fit for use in a month.

351.--Green Mint Vinegar

Put into a wide-mouthed bottle enough fresh, clean mint-leaves to fill it loosely, and fill it up with
good vinegar. After it has been stopped close for two or three weeks, pour off the vinegar clear into
another bottle, and keep it well corked for use. Serve with lamb or kid when fresh mint cannot be
obtained.

352.--Another Way

Fill a wide-mouthed bottle with fresh, full-grown, green mint-leaves; pour in a quart of vinegar; after
ten or fifteen days strain away the liquor, and re-fill the bottle with fresh leaves; pour back the
liquor, and after it has steeped for ten or fifteen days longer, strain and bottle for use as required.

353.--Horseradish Vinegar

To three ounces of finely-scraped horseradish add a quart of vinegar and a drachm of cayenne, some
black pepper and celery-seeds, and one ounce of bruised onions; after eight or ten days filter the
vinegar, which will serve as an excellent relish for cold beef, salads, &c., and for the preparation of
mustard.

354.--Chili Vinegar

Pick, clean, and put into a glass-stoppered bottle one chittack or two ounces of birds'-eye chilies,
and  pour   over   them  a  pint   and  half   of   the  best   vinegar;   after   a   month's time   filter  through
blotting-paper a pint of the vinegar; add to what remains half a pint more of vinegar, and expose it to
the sun for a few days, when the second portion will also be ready for use.

355.--Essence of Chilies

Pick one chittack or two ounces of the best dried Patna chilies; expose them to a hot sun for an
hour; then pound them to as fine a powder as possible; put the powder into a stoppered bottle with a
teaspoonful of salt, pour over it as much vinegar only as will form a limp paste, and expose it to the
sun for a few days; then pass it through muslin, adding to it as much more vinegar as will reduce it to
the consistency of some thick sauce.

356.--To Preserve Lime-juice

Squeeze and strain a pint of lime-juice; put into a basin one pound of double-refined sugar finely
pounded and sifted, add the lime-juice, and stir it with a silver spoon till the sugar is perfectly
dissolved. Bottle it, and cork it tightly; seal the cork, or tie bladder over it, and keep it in a dry, cool
place.

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

357.--To Purify Lime-juice

To a quart of strained lime-juice add an ounce of well-burnt and finely-pounded animal charcoal; in
twelve hours filter it through blotting-paper, and put it into small phials; cork these tightly, and keep
them in a cool place; a thick crust will form beneath the corks, and the mucilage will fall to the
bottom.

358.--Green Mint-juice

If for immediate use, extract it with water, but if required to keep for a few days, take brandy for the
purpose. Pick and clean half a dozen large stalks of good fresh mint, and pound the leaves in a
mortar with a dessertspoonful of water, or with brandy, then put them into muslin and squeeze out
all the liquor. Juice may be extracted a second time by a little more water or brandy being added,
and the leaves rebruised and pressed through muslin.

359.--Green Ginger-juice

Is extracted in the same manner as mint-juice.

360.--Juice of Onions and Garlic

Is extracted by pounding the condiment in a mortar with a little water, and squeezing the juice
through muslin.

361.--Mustard

There are various ways of preparing mustard for the table, each with its admirers, yet in nine houses
out of ten it is often so execrably done as to mar the best dinner, through the loss of its piquancy and
pungency. Be the quantity ever so small, it should never be prepared in a cup, but in a soup or other
deep plate. The dry mustard, with a little salt, should first be well rubbed down with the back of a
spoon; the water, vinegar, or other liquid should then be gradually added, and mixed gently until the
required consistency has been obtained; it should then be mixed briskly, turning the spoon one way
only, and in a few minutes the pungency of the mustard will tell on the eyes; put it immediately into
the mustard-pot, and cork it, removing the cork only when the mustard is required for use. It is a
mistake to suppose that the little silver or plated lid to a mustard-pot is intended, or is sufficient, to
preserve the piquancy and pungency of the condiment. The practice which prevails in some houses
of allowing the spoon to remain immersed in the mustard, which has probably been prepared with
vinegar, the spoon perhaps being a plated one, is very objectionable.

It is scarcely necessary to give any further instructions, excepting that hot water should not be used.
Some like mustard prepared simply with water; others prefer weak vinegar and water. It is also
prepared with plain vinegar, with tarragon vinegar, with vinegar taken from pickles and capers, and
with onion and garlic juice. The best mustard for roast beef is that prepared with horseradish; the
most delicate flavoured is that made with tarragon vinegar, or vinegar taken from capers.

INDIAN PRESERVES, JAMS, JELLIES, AND MARMALADES

Hints about the Making of Preserves

It is not generally known that boiling fruit a long time without sugar, in an open preserving-pan, and
skimming it well, is a very economical way, as the whole of the scum rises from the fruit, and boiling
without a cover allows the evaporation of all the watery particles. Preserves boiled in this way keep
firm and well-flavoured. Jam made as above, with the addition of a quarter of a pound of good pure
sugar to every pound of fruit, is excellent.

362.--To Detect Adulteration of Sugar

The adulteration of brown sugar may be detected by dissolving a little in a glass of clear water; if
sand or any similar substance be present, it will after a while fall to the bottom of the glass. If white
sugar, adulterated with flour, chalk, or other similar substances, be dissolved in clear water, the latter
will become opaque or discoloured, and a sediment will be formed at the bottom of the glass.

363.--White Syrup

Put a quart of water over the fire in a well-tinned and clean copper stewpan; when on the boil, drop
into it lump by lump one pound of the best loaf sugar; let it well boil up, and after all the sugar is
thoroughly dissolved, pour it into a broad dish to cool. When cold it is fit for use.

364.--Brown Syrup

Take a pound of brown sugar-candy called misseree, and prepare the syrup as directed above. After
all the sugar is thoroughly dissolved, strain it through a sheet of stout blotting-paper spread on
muslin, and allow the syrup to drip into a broad dish. Use it when quite cold.

365.--To Clarify Sugar

To every three pounds of loaf sugar allow the beaten white of one egg and a pint and a half of water;
break the sugar small, put it into a nicely cleaned brass pan, and pour the water over it; let it stand
some time before it be put upon the fire; then add the beaten white of the egg, stir till the sugar be
entirely dissolved, and when it boils up pour in a quarter of a pint of cold water, and let it boil up a

77 of 98

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

second time; then remove it from the fire and let it settle for fifteen minutes; carefully take off all
the scum, put it again on the fire, and boil till sufficiently thick, or, if required, till candy high: in
order to ascertain this, drop a little from a spoon into a cup of cold water, and if it become quite
hard, it is sufficiently done; or dip the handle of a wooden spoon into the sugar, plunge it into cold
water, and draw off the sugar which adheres; if the sugar be hard and snaps, the  fruit to be
preserved must be instantly put in and boiled.

366.--Capillaire

To a quart of water add three pounds of lump sugar, one pound of soft sugar, and the whites and
yolks of two eggs well beaten up; boil it gently, and skim well; on the scum ceasing to rise, remove
the pan from the fire, add two ounces of the best orange-flower water, and strain through flannel.

367.--Ceylon Moss, Seaweed, and Iceland Moss Preserves

Steep the moss or weed for two or three days in fresh water, changing the water two or three times a
day; wash it well once before boiling it; to every seer or two pounds of the weed add a wineglassful
of the best vinegar; allow it to simmer over a gentle fire until it thickens, so as to congeal on a glass;
then strain the moss or weed through a towel, pour the liquid into clarified sugar or syrup, and boil
them together for half an hour; pour the jelly into large wide dishes, and when quite cold cut it into
cakes. If desired, the jelly may be coloured or tinted with cochineal.

368.--Guava Jelly

Select ripe guavas, and as they are peeled and quartered throw them into a large bowl of fresh clean
water; then boil them in as much other clean water as will only cover the fruit, and when perfectly
tender, so as to dissolve to the touch, strain through a fine sieve or towel without breaking or
pressing the fruit, and allow it to drip through for  twelve  to eighteen or  twenty-four hours if
necessary. Put the juice on the fire again without a cover to the preserving-pan; boil and skim well;
add gradually good clean sugar to your taste; when nearly done, add lime-juice in the proportion of
ten large juicy limes to every hundred guavas; after it has boiled until no more scum rises, and the
jelly is quite clear, pour it while the jelly is warm into glass or stone jars, and cork them down when
quite cold. A hundred guavas will give two to two and a half jars of jelly, and will take from two to
two and a half hours' cooking or boiling.

369.--Guava Cheese

After all the water or juice has drained from the guavas boiled for jelly, pass the fruit or pulp through
a  sieve, rejecting the  seeds;  add lime-juice  and sugar to taste, and boil over a  slow fire  to a
consistency stiff enough for it to remain unmoved in a spoon; rub a little butter in a mould, fill it
with the cheese while hot, and place it in a heat, or in an expiring oven, to dry; the colour may be
improved with the aid of cochineal.

370.--Mango Jelly

Peel and stone a hundred green mangoes, and cut each into four, throwing them as they are ready
into a solution of weak lime-water, strained of all sediment. When all have been peeled and stoned,
remove them into a large vessel, pour in as much cold water as will entirely cover them, and boil
them until they are quite dissolved; then carefully strain the liquid without pressing the fruit, and let
it drip all night. Boil the juice again in an open preserving-pan, and cut away the scum as it rises;
then add gradually good clean white sugar until it is sweetened to taste; continue to boil steadily
until the scum has ceased to rise, and the jelly is quite clear and transparent; allow some of it to drop
on a plate and cool; if it congeals, remove the pan and fill the bottles while the jelly is slightly warm,
and cork down when quite cold.

371.--Mango Marmalade

Pass through a sieve the pulp of the mangoes which had been boiled for jelly; add plenty of clean
white sugar, without quite destroying the acidity of the fruit; boil it over a slow fire until it acquires

78 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

the thickness of guava cheese, and bottle while it is yet warm.

N.B.--This marmalade is will adapted for rolly-polly puddings, tarts, mango fool, and the preparation
of sauces for boiled goose, ducks, &c.

372.--Green Mango Preserve

Select mangoes slightly under the middling size, taking care that they are not bruised or injured in
any way. Steep them in clean water; grate the outer coat, or peel very finely, so as to remove
thoroughly a fine coat of green from the surface; cut them sufficiently lengthways to extract the
stones, and then throw them into lime-water. Remove them into a copper preserving-pan with clean
water, and parboil them, skimming them well; throw them into a sieve, and allow all the water to
drain away; have a large quantity of good syrup prepared, allowing two pounds of sugar to every
twenty-five mangoes; throw the mangoes into the syrup, and allow them to simmer; cut away the
scum until the sugar inclines to crystallize; then remove the pan from the fire, and put the preserve
into wide-mouthed bottles; before corking them down, it will be necessary to examine the syrup
every two or three days, and if it be found that it is becoming thin, it will have to be reboiled; just as
the boiling is about to be finished, the mangoes ought to be put into it to warm up; this precaution
must be taken every time the syrup has been reboiled, until there is no further appearance of
fermentation; the bottles may then be securely corked down, and the preserve will keep good for
years.

373.--Another Way

Peel and stone good middling-sized green mangoes, and steep them in lime-water; parboil them in
fresh water, and then in syrup until it thickens; put them into bottles, and examine them daily; if any
signs of fermentation appear, reboil the syrup, and put in the fruit at the end of the boiling; the
reboiling to be continued until the syrup has ceased to ferment.

The difference between this and the foregoing preserve is only in appearance: the former will be of a
greenish tint, and the latter of a rich light brown.

N.B.--Care must be taken to have plenty of syrup at the starting, so that at the end of the two or
three reboilings there may be enough left to cover the fruit.

374.--Pine-apple Preserve

Take care that the pines are not green, nor yet quite ripe; remove the peel, cutting it deeply, and then
all the seeds and eyes; cut each pine into six slices, lay them in a preserving-pan, and sprinkle over
each layer a good quantity of sugar, a few sticks of cinnamon, and a few bay-leaves, covering the
uppermost layer with a larger quantity of sugar; allow them to simmer over a tolerably brisk fire
until the sugar has all melted; then reduce the fire, and continue to simmer until the pines have quite
changed colour and become tender; remove them out of the syrup into a colander, and allow them to
drain, but continue to boil the syrup with all that drops from the fruit until it has thickened; then
return the fruit into the syrup and finish the boiling. Bottle when quite cool, but before corking them
for good, ascertain the state of the syrup every two or three days; if it shows signs of fermentation,
remove it from the fruit and reboil it; this operation must be continued until the syrup has ceased to
ferment; the fruit is not to be reboiled, but only returned into the syrup when the boiling is about to
be finished.

375.--Another Way

Finish the preserve by boiling the sliced pines and sugar together until the fruit has become of quite
a dark colour, and the syrup so thick that it is not likely to ferment. There is, however, the objection
to this method that the fruit becomes more or less leathery, and is not mellow like that preserved
according to the foregoing recipe.

376.--Peach Preserve

79 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

Clean the peaches, slit them with a silver or plated knife, and remove the stones; have a very strong
syrup ready, and while it is boiling hot throw in the peaches, and let them stand over a slow fire for
six to eight hours; then remove them from the fire, and twelve hours after drain off the syrup and
reboil it; return the fruit into the syrup, and if it shows any disposition to ferment, boil it again; when
satisfied it will not ferment any more, add a little brandy, say a wineglassful to every fifty peaches,
and boil the whole over a slow fire for two hours. Bottle when quite cold. The kernels from the
stones may be put in if desired.

377.--Another Way

Clean the peaches, and put them with the stones into a preserving-pan with sufficient water to cover
them; allow them to simmer until quite tender, cutting away the scum, and then spread them on a
dish to cool. Make a syrup, allowing three-quarters of a pound of sugar to every pound of fruit, and
while it is boiling hot put in the peaches, and boil them gently until the syrup is quite thick. Two days
after drain off the syrup and reboil it, returning the fruit into it while hot; if at the end of twenty-four
or thirty-six hours it has become thin again, it must be reboiled; a little brandy should be added
finally.

N.B.--If the peaches are boiled in two waters, the first may be thrown away, but the second, in
which the peaches should be boiled a longer time, may be taken for making the syrup.

378.--Pulwal Preserve

Take two seers or four pounds of large full-grown pulwals without any decay; peel, slit, remove the
seeds, and throw them into cold water; wash them thoroughly, and parboil them in clean water; then
put them in a colander, and set them aside to cool. Prepare a good strong syrup of half a seer of
sugar and a quarter of a seer or half a pound of green ginger well bruised; throw the pulwals in, and
allow them to simmer until the syrup thickens. They should be removed immediately the colour
becomes quite brown, but the syrup must be kept boiling till it has acquired the proper consistency;
return the pulwals into the syrup, and, if necessary, reboil it two or three days after, if it appears to
have become thin, or inclined to ferment.

379.--Another Way

Take two seers or four pounds of good large fresh pulwals; thoroughly grate the outer surface, half
slit them, remove the seeds, and throw them into water; parboil them in clean water, remove them
into a colander, and allow them to drain and dry; then stuff each pulwal with some bruised green
ginger, tie or bind them with fine cotton, put them into a strong syrup made of half a seer of sugar,
and allow them to simmer until they change colour; remove them, and continue to boil the syrup
until it thickens; then return them into the syrup, and in two or three days reboil the syrup, if it has
become thin, or appears inclined to ferment.

380.--Candied Pulwal

The same process is observed as directed for pulwal preserve, the chief difference being that hot or
boiling clarified sugar or syrup must be used, and the preserve exposed to the sun, spread out on
fresh oiled paper, to dry.

381.--Tipparee (commonly called Gooseberry) Preserve

Shell or remove the pods of the tipparees, and wipe away all dust; prick each with a bamboo or
other wooden pin, and put them into a preserving-pan; strew some sugar over each layer of fruit,
making the final layer of sugar thicker than the others, and simmer the whole until all the juice has
been extracted, and the syrup has acquired such a consistency that it will congeal if dropped on a
plate; then remove the preserve quickly from the fire, and bottle while warm.

382.--Tipparee Jelly

Clean and prick the tipparees as in the foregoing recipe, and put them into a clean well-tinned

80 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

stewpan, with as much water as will entirely cover them; boil them until all the juice has run out;
strain the latter into a preserving-pan through fine muslin, without crushing the fruit, and allow it to
simmer for a while, removing the scum; then add to it fine clean white sugar to taste, in small
quantities at a time, skimming it well all the while; when nearly ready, put in the juice of two lemons
strained through muslin; when the scum has ceased to rise, and the jelly is clear, remove the pan
from the fire; bottle the jelly while it is warm, and cork when it is quite cold.

383.--Tipparee Cheese or Marmalade

Take the fruit which had been boiled for jelly, and pass it through a fine sieve, leaving the skins
behind; clean and prick a few more tipparees, and add them to the strained fruit; put the whole into
a preserving-pan with sugar, and simmer until of a sufficient consistency to make into cheese; add
some orange marmalade, in the proportion of a tablespoonful to every mould; with a feather damp
the moulds with melted butter or sweet oil, and pour into them the cheese while quite hot; place
them in cold water, and turn out the cheeses as soon as they are cool enough to retain their shape.

384.--To Preserve Tamarinds

Rid the tamarinds of all the stones; put a layer of sugar in a wide-mouthed bottle, and over it a layer
of stoned tamarinds, then another layer of sugar, and so on alternately until the bottle is full; the
final layer must be a deep one of sugar. Tie the stopper down with oiled bladder. This will keep good
for years, and prove serviceable when fresh tamarinds cannot be procured.

385.--Bael Preserve

The fruit must be rather less than half ripe, to enable it to be cut into firm slices a quarter of an inch
thick; carefully remove the seeds, together with the gum by which they are surrounded, and throw
the slices into cold water; when all the bael is ready, remove it from the water, and simmer it in a
strong syrup over a slow fire for half an hour, or until it has become of a rich light brown colour;
bottle it when cool, taking care that the fruit is well covered with syrup.

386.--Bael Jam

The fruit must be half ripe, all the seeds and gum carefully removed, and the pulp passed through a
coarse sieve into a preserving-pan with the help of a little water; add sugar to taste, and simmer over
a slow fire for half an hour, or until the fruit and sugar have acquired the consistency of jam; let it
cool, and then bottle.

387.--Candied Bael

The fruit should be selected as for the preserve, cut into slices, and the seeds and gum removed;
after steeping it in cold water, drain it, and put it in a preserving-pan, with sufficient boiling clarified
sugar or syrup to cover it; simmer it over a slow fire for half an hour, or until it becomes quite
tender; then remove the pan from the fire, lay the fruit on some fresh oiled paper spread on tin trays,
and expose it to the sun; it will crystallize in a few hours, and the oil will prevent it adhering to the
paper.

388.--Orange Jelly

Melt an ounce and a half of isinglass and three-quarters of a pound of fine white sugar in a pint of
water; add some orange and lemon-peel, and boil until it is a good syrup; while warm, add the juice
of ten oranges and two lemons, strain the whole through flannel, and put it into moulds. The juice of
the fruit should not be boiled.

389.--Damson Cheese

Take damsons that have been bottled for tarts, pass them through a sieve, and reject the skins and
stones; to every pound of the strained pulp add half a pound of loaf sugar broken small; boil the
whole until it has thickened; then pour it into buttered moulds and put it in an oven or warm place to

81 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

dry; when quite firm, remove it from the moulds and serve up.

390.--Apricot Cheese

Take the Cabool apricots, or those preserved for tarts; if the former, wash them thoroughly in
several waters, parboil and reduce them to a pulp, and pass them through a sieve, rejecting all the
skin, &c.; add sugar as directed in the foregoing recipe, and a handful or two of the apricot stones
blanched, and boil the whole until it has thickened sufficiently; then pour it into buttered moulds,
put it into an expiring oven or some warm place to dry, and when quite firm turn it out of the
moulds.

N.B.--Other bottled fruits sent out to this country for tarts, not preserved in sugar, are admirably
adapted for converting into marmalades, or for making into "fools."

391.--Orange Marmalade

Take twenty-four oranges and six lemons, and of the best sugar a quantity equal to the weight of the
fruit; grate the rinds of the oranges and lemons; then mark or cut into quarters and strip off the rinds
without hurting the pulps; stew the rinds until they become perfectly tender, changing the water two
or three times; then drain them, scrape out a little of the inside, and cut them into very fine slices or
chips; next separate the pips, skin, and fibrous parts from the pulps, over which pour some water
and strain it off; with this and a little more water prepare a syrup in a preserving-pan, add to it the
whites of two eggs well beaten up, skim it well, and the moment it begins to boil take it off the fire;
continue to remove the scum, add a little more water, boil, and strain until the syrup is perfectly
clear; then throw in the chips and boil until they are quite transparent; next put in all the pulp and
juice, and boil until it thickens. To ascertain if it has been sufficiently cooked, drop a little on a plate
and see if it congeals.

392.--Another Way

Stew good fresh ripe oranges till perfectly tender, changing the water several times; drain them, and
cut and remove the rinds without breaking them or wounding the pulps; weigh the pulps, having
previously removed all the pips, skin, and seeds, and to every six pounds of fruit add seven of sugar;
pour boiling water over the pips, seeds, &c., strain them, and take the liquor for the preparation of
syrup; skim it well while boiling; when clear, add to it the rind, having first scraped and thrown away
some of the inside and then cut it up into thin slices or chips. After a while add the pulp and juice,
and boil it up again until it acquires the consistency of jelly. This is a new method, and approved by
some as being excellent and economical.

393.--Indian Way of Making Calf's-Foot Jelly

Take twelve large or full-sized calves'-feet, one pound or half a seer of sugar, eight limes, two
oranges, half  a  dozen blades of  lemon-grass,  a  tablespoonful  of  mixed  spices (say  cinnamon,
cardamoms, mace, nutmeg, and cloves), six eggs, a handful of isinglass, and a claretglassful of
sherry. Having thoroughly washed the feet, break them up and boil them; allow all the meat to
dissolve over a slow fire, skim away every particle of fat, and strain the liquid through a coarse
napkin; add the sugar, all the hot spices, and the rinds of two lemons and one orange; simmer the
whole for some time, squeeze in the juice of the eight limes and the two oranges, together with the
isinglass and lemon-grass, and when it begins to thicken strain it; then reboil until it is reduced to the
required quantity, skimming all the fat. Beat the whites of the six eggs to a good light froth; add this
to the jelly, and pour it from one pan into another several times, until it clears; then add the sherry
and strain it through flannel, returning it quickly two or three times until it runs perfectly bright and
clear; fill into glasses or moulds before it congeals.

HOME-MADE LIQUEURS

394.--Cream of Citron

Put sixty drops of the oil of citron into a quart of spirits of wine of the strength of sixty-two degrees
overproof; shake it well, mix with it a quart of syrup and two ounces of yellow colouring matter, and
filter the whole through filtering-paper. If not sufficiently bright, filter it a second time through some
fresh paper, and bottle it.

395.--Cream of Cloves

To a quart of spirits of wine of the strength given in the foregoing recipe add forty drops of oil of
cloves; shake it well, and mix with it a quart of syrup, and as much yellow colouring matter as will
give it a good colour; filter through filtering-paper and bottle immediately. It is a delightful liqueur,
and is excellent for relaxed throats.

396.--Cream of Noyau

To a quart of spirits of wine sixty-two degrees overproof add twenty drops of good essential oil of
bitter almonds and six drops of oil of orange; shake it well, and add a quart of syrup; filter it through
paper until it is quite clear.

397.--Pink Noyau

To a quart of spirits of wine sixty-two degrees overproof add fifteen drops of essential oil of bitter
almonds, three drops of oil of roses, four drops of oil of aniseed, and one drop of tincture of vanilla;
shake it well, and mix with it a quart of syrup and a sufficient quantity of pink colouring matter to
make it of a delicate pink colour; bottle it after filtering.

398.--Cream of Aniseed

Put twenty drops of essential oil of aniseed in a quart of spirits of wine; after shaking it well, mix
with it a quart of syrup; filter and put it in bottles.

399.--Cream of Cinnamon

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

To a quart of spirits of wine add two drops of oil of cinnamon and two of oil of roses; shake it well
until the oil has thoroughly dissolved, and add a quart of syrup and a sufficient quantity of red
tincture to produce a bright full colour; it may then be filtered and bottled. This is an agreeable
liqueur, and beneficial to dyspeptic persons.

400.--Rose Cream

Into a quart of spirits of wine put twelve drops of the oil of roses and three of oil of nutmeg; shake
the mixture well until the oils are dissolved, and add a quart of syrup, and a sufficient quantity of
pink tincture to produce a fine rose-colour: filter and bottle.

401.--Cream of Mint

Drop into a quart of spirits of wine twenty-five drops of oil of mint and three of oil of citron; shake
it well, and add a quart of syrup and as much green colouring tincture as may be necessary: filter
and bottle.

402.--Cream of Vanilla

Put twelve drops of tincture of vanilla into a quart of spirits of wine; shake it well, and add a quart
of syrup; when well mixed, let it stand for a quarter of an hour; then filter it two or three times
through filtering-paper, but do not filter again if it comes out bright and clear the first time. This is a
most delicious cordial.

403.--Golden Wasser or Dantzic Brandy

To a quart of spirits of wine add twelve drops of oil of aniseed, six of oil of cinnamon, three of oil of
roses, and eight of oil of citron; shake it will until the oils dissolve; then add a quart of syrup, and
filter through filtering-paper: before bottling the liqueur, stir into it a few squares of leaf-gold cut
into very little bits.

404.--Curacao

Boil a quart of water in a very clean pan, and add to it, bit by bit, a pound of dark brown sugar-
candy; when the latter is dissolved, increase the fire and let the syrup boil up; then pour it into a
deep dish to cool, dissolve a hundred and twenty drops of oil of bitter orange in a quart of spirits of
wine sixty-two degrees overproof, and mix with the syrup when quite cold; then filter and bottle the
liqueur.

This is a most difficult liqueur to filter of a clear bright colour; indeed, all liqueurs in which essential
oils extracted from peals of the lemon tribe are used become so opaque on being mixed with syrup
that the filtering is rendered a most tedious undertaking.

The proportions given in the above recipes are for the production of really good strong liqueurs,
which will keep good for years, and improve by age. Liqueurs for immediate consumption need not
be made quite so strong, two parts of syrup and one of spirits of wine will usually be sufficient; but
consumers will be the best judges of their own tastes. A caution is very necessary against the free
use of the essential oils: they are all harmless in moderation, but poison if used in excess, and some
more powerful than others.

405.--Punch a la Romain

Squeeze the juice out of eight juicy limes and four lemons or oranges; strain it through muslin and
well mix with it two pounds of the best loaf sugar; beat to a light froth the whites of ten fresh eggs,
and add gradually to the sugared juice; pour the whole into a pewter vessel, and place it in a tub
containing two seers of cutcha, or raw ice, stirring it frequently to make it congeal. Ice two quarts of
champagne, and when required add it to the contents of the pewter vessel; mix all well together, and
serve  in green or  amber-coloured  hock glasses. The  addition of a  little  rum is considered an
improvement.

406.--Mint Beer

Put some bruised fresh-gathered mint-leaves into a large tankard, and pour over them a bottle of
beer  well iced, and a  soda-water  bottle  of sparkling lemonade, also well iced; or use  bottled
mint-juice if the beer and lemonade have not been iced, and stir in a quarter of a pound of crushed
ice.

407.--Another Way

To the juice or bruised leaves add sufficient sugar to sweeten, and pour into the tankard two
tumblers of water and two quarts of beer; stir and serve up with crushed ice, or cool the beer and
water before the preparation.

408.--Ginger Beer

Use bruised green ginger instead of mint, and ginger beer instead of lemonade.

409.--"The Commander-in-Chief"

Empty into a punchbowl a quart of claret and a bottle of soda-water; add a wineglassful of curaçao,
and sweeten to taste with sugar; then throw in a handful of picked and bruised mint-leaves, with a
seer of crushed ice; add a quart of champagne, stir briskly, and serve up.

410.--Regent Punch

Mix a quart of sparkling champagne, a claretglassful of brandy, a wineglassful of old Jamaica rum,
and a pint of very strong pure green tea; sweeten to taste with capillaire or any other syrup.

411.--Milk Punch

Six quarts of rum and one of brandy, one quart of lime-juice, two seers of soft sugar, three quarts of
cold water, two seers of pure milk, the rinds of forty limes, and three nutmegs will make twelve
quarts of punch, as follows:--

Steep for two days in a bottle of the rum the peels of the forty limes; boil in the three quarts of water
the two seers of soft sugar, and grate in the nutmeg; pour all the rum and syrup into a large vessel,
and add gradually the quart of lime-juice and two seers of milk, boiling hot, stirring the whole time;
let it stand for an hour or two, then strain through flannel several times until it drips clear, and bottle.

412.--Another Way

Sixteen bottles of rum, three bottles of brandy, four bottles of lime-juice, eight bottles of milk,
twelve bottles of water, eight seers of sugar, eight nutmegs, and the rinds of eighty limes, will make
thirty-six quarts of milk punch, but of a milder quality than the foregoing.

The addition of a bottle of curaçao to milk punch is a great improvement; it may be added after the
milk and lime-juice.

413.--Ginger Pop

Boil an ounce of well-bruised green ginger cleaned of all rind, an ounce of cream of tartar, a pound
of white sugar, some toddy, and some of the rind and all the juice of a large lime, in four quarts of
water, for twenty minutes; when nearly cold, add a claretglassful of good fresh toddy; let it stand for
six hours, and then put into soda-water bottles. It will fill eight or nine bottles.

414.--Imperial Pop

Take three ounces of cream of tartar, an ounce of bruised sugar, a pound and a half of white sugar,
and an ounce of lemon-juice, and pour a gallon and a half of boiling water on them, with two
tablespoonfuls of yeast. Mix, bottle, and tie down the corks as usual.

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

415.--Negus

To two quarts of claret or one of port add a wineglassful of brandy, two limes cut into thin slices, a
slight grating of nutmeg, a few cloves, cardamoms, and sticks of cinnamon, two teacupfuls of boiling
water, and two tablespoonfuls of sugar.

416.--Flash

Mix half a pint of lemon ice with a wineglassful of Jamaica rum; pour over it, stirring briskly, a
bottle of iced ginger beer; drink it while it is effervescing.

417.--Sherry Cobbler

Pour into a tumbler two wineglassfuls of sherry, half a wineglassful of rum, and half a wineglassful
of maraschino; add half an orange sliced fine, and fill the  tumbler with crushed ice;  take  the
preparation through a reed, quill, or common straw.

418.--Apricot Effervescing Drink

Filter until clear a pint of the juice of bruised apricots, and make into a syrup with half a pound of
sugar; then add an ounce of tartaric acid; bottle, and cork well. To a tumbler three parts full of water
add two tablespoonfuls of the syrup and a scruple of carbonate of soda; stir well, and drink while
effervescing.

419.--Mint Julep

Put about a dozen of the young sprigs of mint into a tumbler; add a tablespoonful of white sugar,
half a  wineglassful of peach, and the same  of common brandy; then full up the tumbler  with
pounded ice.

420.--Orangeade

Squeeze out the juice of an orange; pour boiling water on a little of the peel, and cover it close; boil
water and sugar to a thin syrup, and skim it; when cold, mix all together with as much water as well
make a rich drink; strain through a jelly-bag, and ice.

421.--Orgeat

Blanch and pound three-quarters of a pound of sweet and thirty bitter almonds with a tablespoonful
of water; stir in by degrees two pints of water and three pints of milk, and strain the whole through a
cloth; dissolve half a pound of loaf sugar in a pint of water; boil, skim well, and mix with the
almond-water, adding two tablespoonfuls of orange-flower water and a teacupful of good brandy.

422.--Poor Man's Champagne

Put a pint of Scotch ale into a jug, and add a bottle of good ginger beer.

423.--Royal Lemonade

Pare two oranges and six lemons as thin as possible, and steep them four hours in a quart of hot
water; boil a pound and a quarter of the loaf sugar in three pints of water; skim it and add to the two
liquors the juice of six oranges and a dozen lemons; stir well; strain through a jelly-bag, and ice.

424.--Summer Beverage

Pour, while hot, two quarts of barley-water, made as in recipe 426, on the juice and rind of a lemon
very thinly cut; to which add honey, capillaire, or sugar, according to taste; let it stand one hour and
strain.

425.--Lemon Barley-water

86 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

Two tablespoonfuls of pearl barley, a quarter of a pound of lump sugar, rather more than two quarts
of boiling water, and the peel of a fresh lemon make a pleasant drink for summer. It should stand all
night, and be strained the next morning.

MEDICINAL AND OTHER RECIPES

426.--Barley-water for the Sick Chamber

Mix smoothly a teaspoonful of Robinson's patent barley and a tablespoonful of cold spring water
into a smooth paste, and gradually add a quart of boiling water; boil it gently for ten minutes, stirring
occasionally, and strain when cold.

427.--To Cure the Sting of a Wasp

Oil of tartar or solution of potash applied to the part affected will give instant relief.

428.--To Cure Deafness from Deficient Secretion of Wax

Mix half a drachm of oil of turpentine and two drachms of olive oil. Put two drops into the ear at
bedtime.

429.--Cure for Cramp in the Legs

Stretch out the heels and draw up the toes as far as possible. This will often stop a fit of the cramp
after it has commenced.

430.--Emetic Draught

87 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

Mix one grain of emetic tartar, fifteen grains of powder of ipecacuanha, and an ounce and a half of
water. This is commonly employed for unloading the stomach on the accession of fevers, and in
ordinary cases.

431.--Another Recipe

Mix ten grains of blue vitriol (sulphate of copper) and two ounces of distilled water.

432.--Another Recipe

For a draught to be taken directly, mix a scruple of subcarbonate of ammonia, half a drachm of
ipecacuanha in powder, three ounces of peppermint water, and two drachms of tincture of cayenne
pepper. In case of poisoning, this is said to be more certain and effectual in arousing the action of
the stomach than either of the preceding draughts.

433.--Cure for Tic-doloreux or Neuralgia

Mix half a pint of rose-water and two teaspoonfuls of white vinegar. Apply it to the part affected
three or four times a day: fresh linen should be used at each application. This will, in two or three
days, gradually take the pain away.

At least three hundred "infallible cures" for tic-doloreux have been discovered, but the disease
arises from such various causes that no remedy can be relied upon. Carbonate of iron cures one;
quinine, another; upon a third neither has any effect. The remedy above suggested, although safe
and simple, takes time to afford relief. Ten to twenty drops of Collis Browne's chlorodyne have been
found from repeated experience to afford nearly instantaneous relief, and in some cases subject to
periodical return to have effected almost perfect cures.

434.--To Cure Hiccough or Hiccup

This spasm is caused by flatulency, indigestion, and acidity. It may generally be relieved by a sudden
fright or surprise, or the application of cold, also by swallowing two or three mouthfuls of cold water
or a teaspoonful of vinegar, or by eating a small piece of ice, taking a punch of snuff, or anything
that excites coughing.

435.--Cure for Colds

Total abstinence from liquid food of any kind for a day or two (known as the dry system) has been
known to cure coughs and colds where it has been persevered in.

436.--Mixture for Recent Coughs

Mix five ounces of honey, a quarter of a pound of treacle, and seven ounces of best vinegar, and
simmer in a common pipkin for fifteen minutes; remove it from the fire, and when the mixture has
become lukewarm, add two drachms of ipecacuanha wine. The dose is a tablespoonful every four
hours for adults. This is one of the best mixtures known for recent cough, and, on account of its
pleasant taste, is particularly eligible for children and infants.

437.--Emulsion for Recent Coughs

Mix an ounce of oil of sweet almonds, the yolk of one egg, five ounces of orange-flower water, half
an ounce of mucilage of gum Arabic, a drachm and a half of ipecacuanha wine, and half an ounce of
syrup of marshmellows. The dose is a  tablespoonful when the cough is troublesome. Half this
quantity may be given to young children.

438.--Emulsion for Old Coughs

Rub well two drachms of gum ammoniac, gradually adding half a pint of water; when they are
thoroughly mixed, strain them through linen. This is a useful expectorant in old coughs and asthmas,
when no inflammatory symptoms are present. The dose is from one to two tablespoonfuls, united

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

with an equal quantity of almond emulsion.

439.--Cure for Hooping-cough

Dissolve a scruple of salts of tartar in a quarter of a pint of water; add ten grains of cochineal, and
sweeten with sugar. Give to an infant the fourth part of a tablespoonful four times a day; two years
old, half a spoonful; from four years, a tablespoonful.

440.--Roche's Embrocation for Hooping-cough

Mix eight ounces of olive oil, four ounces of oil of amber, and a sufficient quantity of oil of cloves to
scent it strongly. This is the same as the famous embrocation of Roche. When rubbed on the chest, it
stimulates the skin gently, and is sometimes serviceable in hooping-cough and the other coughs of
children. In hooping-cough it should not be used for the first ten days of the disease.

441.--Valuable Lotion for Hooping-cough, &c.

Dissolve one drachm of emetic tartar in two ounces of common water, and add half an ounce of
tincture of Spanish fly. This is a valuable lotion in the advanced stages of hooping-cough, and is of
much service in all other coughs, both of adults and children. It is often very useful in removing the
distressing cough and oppression of the chest left after the hoop has quitted the patient. After it has
been rubbed into the chest night and morning for about a week, it will create a redness, and bring
out some small pustules; it should then be applied only once a day, and if the part becomes very
sore, it may be  laid aside altogether, and the  pustules anointed twice a  day with simple white
ointment. In very severe cases, however, it will be necessary to continue the use of this lotion until a
large number of pustules appear; and if they are kept discharging freely by an occasional use of it,
the relief will be more striking and permanent.

442.--Warm Plaster

Melt together with a moderate heat one part of blistering plaster and fourteen of Burgundy pitch,
and mix them so as to form a plaster. This will be stimulant, and create a slight irritation on the part
to which it is applied. It is used with advantage in common cough, hooping-cough, sciatica, and local
pain.

443.--Gargle for Irritation and Inflammation in the Throat

Mix two drachms of purified nitre, seven ounces of barley-water, and seven drachms of acetate of
honey. Use frequently.

444.--Another Recipe

Mix half a drachm of muriatic acid and seven ounces of decoction of black-current leaves or barley-
water. This and the preceding gargle should be used when the object is to reduce the inflammation in
the throat without its proceeding to suppuration. They are likewise useful in relaxed sore throat. This
gargle possesses cleansing qualities, and should be used when the fauces are clogged with viscid
mucus. It may be made still more detergent, if necessary, by increasing a little the quantity of acid.

445.--A Good Gargle for Sore Throats

Mix two drachms of tincture of myrrh, four ounces of water, and half an ounce of vinegar.

446.--Excellent Domestic Gargle

Mix together, in a half-pint tumbler, three teaspoonfuls of vinegar, two of tincture of myrrh, two of
honey, and about one-fourth of a tumbler of port wine; then fill up the tumbler with lukewarm
water, and the gargle will be fit for use. This is both pleasant and efficacious in all cases of sore
throat. If a decoction of black-currant leaves be used instead of lukewarm water, it will be much
improved.

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

447.--Remedy for Sprains

Mix together one ounce each of camphorated spirit, common vinegar, and spirits of turpentine.

448.--Another Recipe

Put the white of an egg into a saucer, and stir it with a piece of alum, about the size of a walnut, until
it becomes a thick jelly; apply a portion of it on a piece of lint or two large enough to cover the
sprain, changing it for a fresh one as often as it gets warm or dry, and keep the limb in a horizontal
position.

449.--Embrocation for Sprains and Bruises

Mix together an ounce and a half of compound liniment of camphor and half an ounce of tincture of
opium.   This   is   a   very   useful   application   to   sprains   and   bruises,   after   all   inflammation   has
disappeared, and for rheumatic pains. Warmed and rubbed over the surface of the abdomen, it is of
much service in allaying the pain of colic unattended by inflammation.

450.--Another Recipe

Mix an ounce of solution of acetate of ammonia and an ounce of soap liniment. This is useful when
the bruises or sprains are accompanied with inflammation.

451.--Lime Liniment for Burns, Scalds, &c.

Mix together equal parts of linseed or common olive oil and lime-water. Well shake the liniment
every time it is used.

452.--Spermaceti Ointment for Dressing Blisters

Melt an ounce of white wax and a quarter of an ounce of spermaceti in two ounces of olive oil, and
stir the mixture till it becomes cold.

453.--To Prevent Galling in Persons confined to their Beds

Beat the white of an egg to a strong froth, and gradually drop in two teaspoonfuls of spirits of wine;
put the mixture into a bottle, and apply occasionally with a feather.

454.--Anodyne Fomentation

Boil three ounces of white poppy-heads, half an ounce of elder-flowers, and three pints of water till
one pint is evaporated; then strain out the liquor. This fomentation is used to relax spasm and relieve
acute pain. Sometimes it may be advisable to add three teaspoonfuls of tincture of opium to it.

455.--Common Fomentation

Boil an ounce of dried mallows, half an ounce of dried camomile-flowers, and a pint of water for a
quarter of an hour, and strain. This is a very good fomentation for all common occasions.

456.--Nitric Acid Lotion

Mix together two drachms of diluted nitric acid and a pint of water. This lotion is stimulating and
detergent, and is very serviceable when applied to foul foetid ulcers attended with a thin ichorous
discharge. It is also useful in caries of the bone, and when there is an impending mortification. It is a
favourite lotion in unhealthy ulcerations, which require the application of a mild stimulant.

457.--Cure for Bowel Complaint

Mix half a drachm of rhubarb powder, a drachm of calcined magnesia, an ounce of paregoric elixir,
and half a pint of peppermint water. Shake up, and take two tablespoonfuls every three hours till

relieved.

458.--Another Recipe

The following is a better prescription for the same purpose:--Mix eight ounces of chalk mixture, a
drachm of aromatic confection, three drachms of compound tincture of camphor, and three or four
drops of oil of caraways. Take two tablespoonfuls every three hours, or oftener if the pain and
purging be urgent; a teaspoonful is a dose for young children, and one tablespoonful for those of ten
or twelve years of age.

459.--Compound Infusion of Senna

Macerate for an hour in a pint of boiling water, in a lightly covered vessel, an ounce and a half of
senna-leaves and a drachm of sliced ginger-root, and strain the liquor. This is a useful purging
infusion, in common use among medical men. It is usually given in conjunction with a little Epsom
or Glauber's salts, and forms a purging mixture of great service in all acute diseases.

460.--Warm Purgative Tincture

Put three ounces of senna-leaves, three drachms of bruised caraway-seeds, a drachm of cardamom-
seeds, and four ounces of stoned raisins into two pints of best brandy; macerate for fourteen days in
a gentle heat, and filter. This is quite equal to the celebrated Daffy's elixir, and is similar to the
tincture of senna sold at the shops. It is stomachic and purgative, and is beneficially employed in
flatulency, pains in the bowels, gouty habits, and as an opening medicine for those whose bowels
have  been weakened  by intemperance. The  dose  is one, two, or three  tablespoonfuls, in  any
agreeable vehicle.

461.--Tonic Aperient Mixture

Mix three ounces and a half each of decoction of bark and infusion of senna, three drachms of
sulphate of potash, and half an ounce of compound tincture of bark. Take three tablespoonfuls once
or twice a day, so as to keep the bowels regular; or it may be used only occasionally, when an
aperient is required.

462.--Mild Aperient Pills

Beat into a mass and divide into twelve pills half a drachm of compound extract of colocynth, a
scruple of compound rhubarb pill, ten grains of Castille soap, and five drops of oil of juniper. These
are excellent aperient pills for occasional use in costiveness, bilious affections, and on all ordinary
occasions, and are suited to the relief of these complaints in children as well as in adults. One pill
taken at bedtime is generally sufficient, but some persons may require two.

463.--Digestive Aperient Pills

Well rub thirty-six or forty grains of socotrine aloes with eighteen grains of gum mastic, and add
twenty-four  grains each  of  compound extract  of  gentian and compound  galbanum pill, and  a
sufficient quantity of oil of aniseed to make twenty pills. Take two or three, an hour before dinner,
or at night. They are stomachic and aperient, containing an antispasmodic, and producing usually a
full feculent evacuation. They are very suitable to persons who have no vital energy to spare, and
require a medicine which will operate mildly, surely, and safely.

464.--Worm Powder

Rub well together two or three grains of calomel and ten grains of compound powder of scammony.
This is an efficacious powder for the expulsion of worms from children and adults, and may be given
twice a week, or oftener, till the object be accomplished.

465.--Infallible Cure for Tapeworm

Take   of  the  plant   Gisekia  pharmaceoides,  in  its green,  fresh  state, leaves,  stalks, seeds,  and

91 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

seed-capsules (if the plant be in seed or forming its seed-vessels) indiscriminately one pound, and
grind it down with sufficient water to render it liquid. It should be administered to the patient after
twelve hours of fasting, and repeated on the fourth and eighth days. As a precautionary measure, to
destroy any latent germs, repeat the dose in eight days more. The Gisekia is free of every poisonous
quality: it simply possesses an acrid volatile principle, fatal alone to the tapeworm, and is in no way
distressing to the stomach or digestive organs. The plant flourishes most luxuriantly in the jungles at
Ferozepore, cis-Sutlej territories, Cawnpore, Seharunpore, Egypt, Coromandel, the banks of the
Irrawaddie, in Burmah, and throughout Oude. As a specific it was first brought to European notice
by a fakeer at Ferozepore, about the year 1856.

N.B.--The dried plant is useless.

466.--Cure for Ringworm

The parts should be washed twice a day with soft soap and warm water; when dry, rub them with a
piece of linen rag dipped in ammonia from gas tar; the patient should take a little sulphur and
treacle, or some other gentle aperient, every morning; brushes and combs should be washed every
day, and the ammonia kept tightly corked.

467.--Quinine Draught

For dyspepsia and hepatic derangement mix two grains of sulphate of quinine, two drops of diluted
sulphuric acid, one drachm of spirit of nutmegs, and ten drachms of distilled water, and take daily at
midday.

468.--Seidlitz Powders

Two drachms of tartarized soda and two scruples of bicarbonate of soda for the blue paper; thirty
grains of tartaric acid for the white paper.

469.--Ginger-beer Powders

Half a drachm of bicarbonate of soda, with a grain or two of powdered ginger and a quarter of an
ounce of sugar, for the blue paper; twenty-five grains of tartaric acid for the white paper.

470.--Lemonade Powders

Omit the ginger powder from the above, and to the water add a little essence of lemon or lemon-
juice.

PERFUMERY, COSMETICS, AND DENTIFRICE

471.--Indian Mode of Preparing Perfumed Oils

The natives never make use of distillation. The plan adopted is to place on a large tray a layer of the
flowers, about four inches thick and two feet square; on this they put some of the til or sesamum
seed, wetted or damped, about two inches thick; on this, again, is placed another layer of flowers,
four inches thick; the whole is then covered with a sheet, held down by weights at the sides, and
allowed to remain for eighteen hours. The flowers are then removed and replaced by layers of fresh
flowers, and the operation repeated three times, each layer of fresh flowers being allowed to remain
eighteen hours. After the last process, the seeds are taken in their swollen state and placed in a clean
mill; the oil then expressed possesses most fully the scent of the flowers. It is kept in prepared skins,
called dubbers, and sold at so much per seer. The jasmine, bela, and chumbræl are the flowers from
which the natives chiefly produce the oil.

472.--Remedy for Scurf in the Head

Drop a lump of fresh quicklime the size of a walnut into a pint of water, and let it stand all night;
pour the water off clear from sediment, add a quarter of a pint of the best vinegar, and wash the

head with the mixture. It is perfectly harmless; only the roots of the hair need be wetted.

473.--Imitative Bears' Grease

Melt together until combined eight ounces of hogs' lard and one-eighth of an ounce each of flowers
of benzoin and palm oil; stir until cold, and scent at pleasure. This will keep a long time.

474.--Hair Grease

Dissolve a quarter of a pound of lard in a basin of boiling water; when cold, strain off the water and
squeeze  the  lard  dry  in  a   cloth;   after  which  melt  it  in  a   pipkin, and  mix well with  it   three
tablespoonfuls of salad oil and enough palm oil to give it a colour. When cold, or nearly so, scent it
and put it into pots. A little white wax may be added to make it thicker or stiffer.

475.--Pomatum

Take a pound of white mutton suet, well boiled in a quart of hot water, and washed to free it from
salt, &c.; when dried, melt it with half a pound of fresh lard and a quarter of a pound of bees' wax;
pour it into an earthen vessel, and stir till it is cold; then beat into it fifteen drops of oil of cloves, or
any essential oil whose scent is preferred. If too hard, use less wax.

476.--Another Recipe

Take four ounces of lard, an ounce of castor oil, a quarter of an ounce of spermaceti, an ounce and a
half of salad oil, a quarter of an ounce of white wax, a drachm and a half of tincture of lytæ, and
twenty drops of oil of roses, verbena, bergamot, or cloves. Melt the wax, spermaceti, and lard with
the oils in a glazed earthen pipkin, and when nearly cold add the scent.

477.--Pomade for Hair that is Falling off

Take eight ounces of beef marrow, twenty-two drops of tincture of cantharides, sixty grains of sugar
of lead, an ounce of spirits of wine, and twenty drops of oil of bergamot. Boil the marrow in the
bone, and mix the prescribed quantity, free of bone and fibre, with the other ingredients, excepting
the scent, which is to be added last of all; if any other scent be preferred, the bergamot may be
omitted.

478.--Pomade Divine

This is a capital pomade for rubbing into bruises, or to give relief in any similar hurt:--Take a pound
and a half of beef marrow, which will be the produce of six or eight bones; clear it thoroughly from
bone and fibre, and put it in an earthen vessel of spring water; change the water every night and
morning for eight or ten days; then steep the marrow in a pint of rose-water for twenty-four hours,
and drain it dry through a linen cloth. Take an ounce of flowers of benzoin, cyprus-root, odoriferous
thorn, and Florentine iris-root, half an ounce of cinnamon, and a quarter of an ounce each of cloves
and nutmeg. Pound all these very fine, and mix them well with the marrow; then put all into a
pewter digester which holds three pints, and let the top be closely fitted. Spread on linen a paste
made of flour and white of egg, and fix it over the top so that there can be no evaporation. Suspend
the digester by the handles in the middle of a pot of boiling water, and keep it boiling, adding more
boiling water as often as necessary. Strain the pomade into small wide-mouthed bottles, and cover it
down when quite cold.

479.--Another Recipe

Take three-quarters of a pound of beef-marrow; clean it well from bone and fibre, and wash it in
water fresh from the spring, which must be changed night and morning for ten days; then steep it in
rose-water for twenty-four hours, and drain it. Take half an ounce each of storax, gum benjamin,
and odoriferous cyprus-powder, two drachms of cinnamon, and a  drachm of cloves. Let these
ingredients be all powdered and well mixed with the marrow, and put them in a pewter pot which
holds about a pint and a half. Make a paste of white of egg and flour, and lay it on a piece of linen,

and place a second linen to cover the pot very tight and keep in the steam. Place the pot in a copper
vessel of water, and keep it steady, so that the water may not reach or touch the covering. As the
water evaporates, add more, boiling hot, and keep it boiling four hours without ceasing. Strain the
pomade into small jars or boules, and cork when quite cold. Take care to touch it only with silver.

480.--Bandoline for the Hair

Mix two ounces of olive oil with one drachm each of spermaceti and oil of bergamot; heat and
strain; then beat in six drops of otto of roses. If colour be desired, add half a drachm of annatto.

481.--Dentifrice

Scrape as much whiting to a fine powder as will fill a pint pot; moisten two ounces of camphor with
a few drops of brandy, rub it into a powder, and mix with the whiting half an ounce of powdered
myrrh. Bottle it, and keep it well corked down, taking small quantities out in a separate bottle for
daily use.

482.--Another Recipe

Dissolve two ounces of borax in three pints of boiling water; before quite cold, add a teaspoonful of
tincture  of  myrrh  and  a  tablespoonful of  spirits of  camphor: bottle  the  mixture  for  use. One
wineglassful of the  solution, with half a pint of tepid water, is sufficient for each  application.
Applied daily, it preserves and beautifies the teeth, extirpates all tartarous adhesion, produces a
pearl-like whiteness, arrests decay, and induces a healthy action in the gums.

483.--Another Recipe

No dentifrice in the world can equal that of powdered betel-nut if properly prepared, but very few
know how to do this: the nuts should not be burnt, but sliced and roasted, like coffee, to a rich
brown colour, and then pulverised and passed through fine muslin; the grit should then be repounded
and strained through muslin, and this operation continued until all the powder is finely sifted. The
colour, instead of being black, like charcoal, should be a fine rich chocolate-colour. The dentifrice
may then be used as it is, or tincture of myrrh and camphor and eau de Cologne may be added to it.

484.--Rose Lip-salve

Take an ounce and a half of spermaceti, nine drachms of white wax, twelve ounces of oil of sweet
almonds,  two   ounces of   alkanet-root,  and   one   drachm  of  otto  of   roses;  digest   the   first  four
ingredients with the heat of boiling water for four hours, then strain through flannel, and add the otto
of roses.

485.--Essence of Roses

Mix two drachms of otto of roses and a pint of rectified spirits of wine.

486.--Essence of Lemon-peel

Steep six ounces of lemon-peel, cut very thin and without any particle of the white skin, in eight
ounces of spirits of wine well corked.

487.--Eau de Cologne

Put twelve drops each of oil of neroli, citron, bergamot, orange, and rosemary, and a drachm of
cardamom-seeds, into a pint of spirits of wine, and let it stand for a week.

488.--Lavender-water

Mix two drachms of oil of lavender, half a drachm of oil of bergamot, a drachm of essence of musk,
thirteen ounces of spirits of wine, and five ounces of water, and let it stand a week.

MISCELLANEOUS USEFUL RECIPES

489.--To Unite Broken Glass or China

Rub the edges of the pieces that require mending with the white of an egg, and then dust some slack
lime upon them; hold them together till they stick, and let them dry. This cement is not liable to be
softened by heat.

490.--Cement for Attaching Metal to Glass or Porcelain

Mix two ounces of a thick solution of glue with one ounce of linseed-oil varnish or three-quarters of
an ounce of Venice turpentine. Boil together, agitating until the mixture becomes as intimate as
possible. The pieces cemented should be fastened together for forty-eight or sixty hours.

491.--Japanese Cement

This is made by thoroughly mixing rice-flour with cold water, and then gently boiling it; it is
beautifully white, and dries almost transparent.

492.--To Clean Silks, Satins, Coloured Woollen Dresses, &c.

Mix well together a quarter of a pound each of soft soap and honey, the white of an egg, and a
wineglassful of gin; the article should be scoured thoroughly with rather a hard brush, rinsed in cold
water, left to drain, and ironed whilst damp.

493.--To Remove Stains from Mourning Dresses

Boil a handful of fig-leaves in two quarts of water until reduced to a pint. Bombazines, crape, cloth,
&c., need only be rubbed with a  sponge dipped in this liquor, and the stains will be instantly
removed.

494.--To Remove Ironmould

Rub the spot with a little powdered oxalic acid, or salts of lemon, and warm water. Let it remain a
few minutes, and then well rinse it in clear water.

495.--To Clean Kid Gloves

First see that your hands are clean; then put on the gloves and wash them, as though you were
washing your hands, in a basin of spirits of turpentine, until quite clean; hang them up in a warm
place, or where there is a good current of air, which will carry off all smell of the turpentine.

496.--To Clean Feathers

To every gallon of water allow half a pound of quick-lime; stir the mixture well, and let it stand a
night; then pour off the water that is perfectly clear, put the feathers to be cleaned into a deep tub,
and pour in as much lime-water as will cover them; let them stand two or three days, stirring them
frequently; then put them into a bag, and wash them thoroughly in cold water; turn them out on
sieves, and wring the water from them by squeezing them in small portions with the hands, after
which they may be separated, the hard quills picked out, and the down stripped from the large
feathers. When they are  thus carefully cleaned, lay them on a  floor where  air  can be   freely
admitted; turn and shake them frequently, and when dry, put them into bags, and beat them on a
knocking-stone with a knocker.

497.--To Wash Lace

Place the lace in folds, and baste it on each side; lay it in cold water for a night, and wash it in cold
water with the best white soap; gently rub and squeeze it; wash it in three or four waters with the
soap, and rinse it well in clean water; then put it into thin starch or rice-water; take out the basting
thread, and spread it on a blanket upon a bed to dry; when it is nearly so, pick it out, and lay it in

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

folds, and when quite dry, lay it in an old cambric handkerchief, and then in the folds of a towel; put
it upon the rug, or upon a blanket laid upon a stone, and with a heavy wooden pestle, or rolling-pin,
beat it hard till it looks quite smooth. A scarf or veil, after being starched, should be pinned out tight
upon a cloth on the floor, and when dry, beaten in the same manner.

498.--To Wash Head and Clothes Brushes

Put a dessertspoonful of pearl-ashes into a pint of boiling-water, and shake the brush about in it till it
is perfectly clean; then pour some clean hot water over it; shake, and dry it before the fire.

499.--To Clean Gold Chains, Earrings, &c.

Make a lather of soap and water, and boil the chain in it for a few minutes; immediately on taking it
out, lay it in magnesia powder which has been heated by the fire, and when dry, rub it with flannel;
if embossed, use a brush.

500.--To Clean Plate

Boil an ounce each of cream of tartar, alum, and common salt in a gallon of water; put the plate in
and boil it, and when taken out and rubbed dry it will have a fine polish. Plate, when laid aside, will
generally tarnish, but if cleaned by this method at stated periods, it will always look well.

501.--To Clean Marble

Sift  through a  fine  sieve two parts of common soda, one of pumice-stone, and one  of finely-
powdered chalk, and mix it with water; rub it well all over the marble, and the stains will be
removed; then wash the marble with soap and water, and it will be perfectly clean.

THINGS WORTH KNOWING

502.--To Make Stale Bread Fresh

If stale bread be immersed in cold water for a moment or two, and rebaked for about an hour, it will
be for the time in every respect equal to newly-baked bread; but the deception will be found out in
the course of a few hours.

503.--How to Select and Keep Coffee

In purchasing coffee, always prefer the Mocha--a small roundish berry of a bluish tint. Never buy it
roasted; a coffee-roaster can be procured at a reasonable price, and the trouble of roasting and
grinding it at home is not very great. Let it be kept in a plain tin canister, and when roasted and
ground transfer it to a smaller air-tight one, as nothing deteriorates coffee so much as exposure to
the light and air after it has been roasted.

504.--Lettuce Salad

Salads should be very fresh, carefully washed, picked, and dried in a clean cloth, cut up separately,
and put into the bowl only just before they are required for use. The salad mixture should be placed
at the bottom of the bowl and the salad on top; if mixed, the leaves lose that crispness which is so
delicious. Slices of beet, eggs, or boiled potatoes are placed on the top to garnish.

505.--Substitute for Cream in Tea or Coffee

Beat the white of an egg to a froth, and mix well with it a very small lump of butter; then add the
coffee to it gradually, so that it may not curdle. If perfectly done, it will be an excellent substitute for
cream.

506.--Another Way

Beat up, separately, the yolk and white of an egg; transfer them into a large cup, and pour over it

96 of 98

4/19/2013 7:22 PM

The Indian Cookery Book

http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500071h.html

sweetened coffee, scalding hot. Skim away the froth, and fill the coffee into a cup of the required
size.

507.--To Protect Bed Linen and Curtains from Burning

Add an ounce of alum to the last water in which the linen and curtains are to be rinsed, and they will
be rendered inflammable, or so slightly combustible that they would take fire very slowly, if at all.
This is a simple precaution, and is recommended where there are children and in the sick chamber.

508.--To Prevent the Smoking of a Lamp

Soak the wick in strong vinegar, and dry it well before using it; it will then burn both sweet and
pleasant, and give much satisfaction for the trifling trouble in preparing it.

509.--Transparent Paper

Paper can be made as transparent as glass, and capable of being substituted for many purposes, by
spreading over it on both sides, with a feather, a very thin layer of resin dissolved in spirits of wine.
Fine thin post paper is the best for the purpose.

510.--To Take Impressions of Leaves

A very beautiful and cheap way of taking impressions of leaves is to take a small quantity of
bichromate of potass (say a teaspoonful), which may be had at any druggist's or colourman's shop;
dissolve it in a saucerful of water, and pass the paper on which the impressions are to be taken
through the solution; while wet press the leaves lightly upon it, and expose it to the sun, which
should be shining powerfully. When perfectly dry, remove the leaves, and perfect facsimile will
remain in a light lemon shade, while the rest of the paper will be of a dark brown tint. Bichrome, as
it is generally termed, is in dark yellow crystals, which should be powdered previous to using it.

511.--To Take Impressions of Leaves on Silk, &c.

Prepare two rubbers by tying up wool, or any other substance, in wash-leather; then rub up with
cold-drawn linseed oil the wished-for colours, as indigo for blue, chrome for yellow, &c.; dip the
rubbers into the paint, and rub them one over the other, so that too much may not remain upon
them; place a leaf on one of the rubbers and damp it with the other; take the leaf off and apply it to
the silk, satin, paper, or other substance you wish stamped; place a piece of paper on the leaf, and
rub it gently, and there will be a beautiful impression of all the veins. Leaves can only be used once;
they should be nearly all the same size, or the pattern will not look uniform.
